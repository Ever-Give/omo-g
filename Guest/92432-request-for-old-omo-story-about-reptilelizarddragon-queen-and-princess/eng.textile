It was a story i read a while ago and can't find it anywere. its about a royal family in a castle from the middle ages, i think it was a race half human, half lizard/reptile/dragon something like that. while the pure humans served them as knights, guards, maids...etc

The princess has to go and can't make it after being at a meeting inside the castle for too long, so her mohter (the queen) takes her away and with the help of a human guard they use a huge pot i think in the middle of the hallway, so they take the princess dress of, she pees everywere and then into the pot. and in the end the queen reveals her ass to the guard, also pees on the pot and then tells him he didn't saw nothing.

Anyone know about the story im talking about?
