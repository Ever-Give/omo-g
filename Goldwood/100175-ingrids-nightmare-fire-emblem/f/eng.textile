I haven't touched the Three Houses cast in a while, but yesterday I received a flood of inspiration for a duo I hadn't featured yet. Enjoy!

The sweltering heat of Ailell, the Valley of Torment, beat down on Ingrid and her peers as she waited for her suitor to appear. She gripped her lance tightly as she uneasily watched the lava bubble around them. Dorothea fanned herself while complaining about the heat, but the class was so on edge that not even Sylvain cracked a bad joke about being hot.

“There he is. He looks just as insufferable as I remember,” Dorothea said as the alleged suitor approached.

Ingrid’s heart pounded as she looked the man in the eyes. They were a far cry from the soft eyes of someone wishing to marry her. “I came. What is it that you really want?”

“The same as every other noble in Fodlan. Land. Power. A woman to call my own.”

Ingrid pointed her lance at him. Behind her, Dorothea summoned Thunder and Byleth drew the Sword of the Creator. “I’m not going to marry you.”

The “suitor” laughed. “It was never about marriage.”

The valley became a battlefield in an instant. Enemies forces charged as the nobleman instructed them to kidnap Ingrid at all costs. Ingrid navigated her pegasus over pools of lava and between rocky spires while avoiding arrows and swooping down to strike at her foes. Her class rallied around her as she looked for a means of escape, but there were few options. She tried to find the best route, but there was always a monster, an ambush, or a trek across open craters for those on foot. Worry clouded Ingrid’s mind bringing its frequent companion with it. She hadn’t peed in several hours and could feel her resolve slipping as the stress of battle led to several leaks.

Then her friends started to fall. Dedue sacrificed himself to save Dimitri. Then Dimitri, Felix, and Sylvain were lost in an ambush. Mercedes was hit by an arrow as she tried to heal a bleeding Annette. Each was a stab to both her heart and her bladder.

“No. Please no! This is all my fault!”

Ingrid frantically scanned the battlefield for any sign of the horrible man who’d plotted the ambush. She managed to spot him, but her flight was cut short as an arrow tore through the wing of her pegasus. She screamed and fell to her doom, bladder emptying on the way down.

“Ingrid. Ingrid. Are you okay?”

Ingrid’s racing heart slowed as she returned to the real world. Her skin was hot to the touch and her hair and nightgown were matted with sweat. Her legs were warm for a different reason. A massive stain spread out beneath her soaking her clothes, blankets, and stretching as far as the other side of the bed. She felt a hand on her shoulder and smiled as Dorothea pulled her closer and assured her everything was alright.

“I had that dream about Ailell again. I don’t know why. It’s been years since the last time! But the result in the real world was the same. It’s always the same.”

Dorothea squeezed her hand. “Sometimes our brains and bladders are stupid.”

Ingrid’s face flushed with embarrassment. “Easy for you to say. Your not the one who turns 30 next moon and still wets the bed like a child!”

“But you’re making so much progress!”

Ingrid reluctantly nodded and followed Dorothea’s eyes across the room. In the dim morning light, she saw the chalkboard with a series of tally marks that counted to 48. It was her longest dry streak, but all things had to end. “I know rationally that I’m doing better. I know that my sleep disorder and overactive bladder are valid excuses. But it’s still humiliating.”

Dorothea kissed her. “I hate seeing my Ingrid sad. Would you like me to make this better?”

“I mean, you’re welcome to run a bath.”

Dorothea shook her head. “I was thinking along different lines.”

Suddenly, the bedding around Ingrid grew warm and wet a second time. Ingrid frantically checked her nightgown fearing she’d had a follow-up accident while awake, but the mischievous smile on Dorothea’s face told her everything.

“Dorothea, you really didn’t have to…”

“I felt pretty full anyway and wanted to let you know you’re not alone.”

Ingrid snuggled closer. “You’re the best.”

Ingrid woke up a few hours later. Dorothea had changed and was sitting at her desk working on a song for her next opera in the light of a candle. Then Ingrid blushed as she saw the stack of diapers next to her.

“Good morning. Um… do I have to…”

Dorothea smiled, but held firm. “You know the rules. The accidents usually come in waves, so you’ll have to stay dry for a week.”

Ingrid nodded. “That’s fair.” Then a funny thought struck her. “Hey Dorothea.”

“Yes?”

“Technically, you had an accident last night as well.”

Dorothea gave her sly smile. “I suppose I did. Would you feel better if I diapered up as well.”

Ingrid found herself grinning like an idiot. “I would.”

“Then you shall get your wish. But first we’ve got to get you in the bath and wash these sheets!”

Once Ingrid helped pull off the soaked sheets and headed to the bathroom, Dorothea walked to the chalkboard and erased the tally marks. Hers eyes wandered to the bag of diapers and rather than leaving the board blank, she added a row for “D” and another for “I.”

“The things we do for love.”
