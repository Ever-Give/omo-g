Haven't seen much Omo content for Engage, so here's a little one shot I wrote 🙂

Ivy raced toward Elusia Castle as it fell. It broke her heart that she hadn’t been there, but she’d come as fast as she could once she heard the screams. Out in the streets, men, women, and children all panicked. She tried to use her status as First Princess to assure them it would be okay, but that did little good.

“King Hyacinth is dead. Eaten by the Fell Dragon he tried to resurrect!” a man shouted as his children began to cry.

Ivy had heard those two sentences repeated ad nauseum as she tried to make her way back to the castle. The man who’d raised herself and Hortensia had gone mad with a power he could not understand before dying one of the most gruesome deaths imaginable. She hoped it was a lie but knew deep down it wasn’t. She still had to save her sister though!

There was a ghastly roar as castle walls crumbled and the Fell Dragon climbed out onto the battlements. Ivy scanned the area for Hortensia but there was no sign of her sister. She took a deep breath and mounted her wyvern flying straight into the action. The Corrupted swarmed the castle walls spread out into the streets attacking knights and civilians alike. Ivy cast Arcfire as she flew hoping that she could make some kind of difference in her kingdom’s darkest hour.

Then she heard Hortensia scream. She was in the courtyard. Ivy took off in that direction only to come face to face with the Fell Dragon. She unleashed her strongest spells at the hideous beast, but they effectively bounced off and enraged the dragon further. The Fell Dragon unleashed a blast of dark energy which hit her wyvern in the tail. Ivy screamed as she began to plummet to the ground.

She landed with a crash and felt several broken bones in her leg. She tried to unbuckle from her wyvern’s saddle, but a wave of Corrupted surrounded her. There was no way she could possibly fight them all. Her blood ran cold and her legs grew warm as her bladder voided adding some humiliation to her own death at the Fell Dragon’s hands.

“Hortensia!” she screamed.

Back in the Somniel, Ivy jolted awake. Her racing heart slowed as she found Hortensia sleeping across from her on the other side of the room. That calmed Ivy down until she became acutely aware of her predicament. She was lying in a massive puddle. A giant stain covered her sheets, and her nightgown was naturally soaked as well. She’d peed an awful lot and the pungent smell meant she had to clean up immediately.

She’d had recurring nightmares since leaving Elusia, but they’d never gotten this bad. She was the First Princess of Elusia, and she’d wet the bed like a small child! Her face burned with embarrassment as she pulled her blankets off the bed and tiptoed out the door. At least there were several more hours till dawn.

The Somniel was silent aside from the animals snoozing in the yard by the farmhouse. Ivy made her way to the grotto as fast as possible to avoid being discovered. She entered the cave and was thankful the guardian spirit Somni now slept in Alear’s room. The little guy would not like what Ivy was about to do to the water in his grotto. Ivy sat down in the pool and was relieved as the cool water washed over her and took the humiliating stain on her gown with it. She then climbed out and submerged her blankets. A slight odor remained, so she dunked them in the pool a few more times. Feeling satisfied, she headed to the corner of the cave to spread her blankets out.

Ivy stopped in her tracks. Another set of wet blankets were lying in the spot she planned on using. Her heart raced. “Who else is awake at this hour?” she hadn’t noticed anyone on her walk, but had admittedly been half asleep. She nervously ventured outside the grotto in search of another place to dry her blankets.

She found Yunaka leaning against the grotto wall with a relieved smile on her face. There was just enough light for Ivy to see her pants growing a shade darker as she sat in a steadily growing puddle. She made eye contact with Ivy and stifled a scream as Ivy dropped her blankets in shock.

“I… Um… Hi Princess Ivy. This isn’t what it looks like, I swear!” Yunaka said.

“So, you’re not peeing your pants in the middle of the night?” Ivy asked.

Yunaka’s face went crimson as she tried to come up with an explanation before stopping herself. “Wait a minute. You’re carrying wet blankets! Explain yourself!”

“I had a terrible dream with some side effects that carried over to the real world,” Ivy said with a blush.

Yunaka nodded. “I can’t imagine what you’re dealing with given the current state of Elusia. If it makes you feel any better, I had a nightmare of my own and also wet the bed. I had to pee again by the time I was done washing my blankets and I just went cause my pants are wet anyway."

“Well, I’m not sure what exactly you’re dealing with, but I hope your dreams can go back to normal soon,” Ivy said.

“I hope the same for you. But while you're here... Would you be willing to summon some fire spells and speed up the drying process? Yunaka asked.

“Good plan,” Ivy said.

Yunaka dipped in the grotto’s pool and came back to Ivy and the blankets. Ivy summoned a floating ball of fire that warmed their clothes and blankets by the time the sun came up.

“Hey Ivy?” Yunaka said.

“Yes?”

“Let’s do ourselves a favor and never speak of this again,” Yunaka said.

Ivy nodded. “I think that would definitely be for the best.”

This is incredibly cute! This is the first Engage omo fic to have a female focus. The rest I've seen were about Alcryst and Amber! Can't wait for your next one!

Oh wow! Well if there's a hole in the market I might as well captitalize... 👀
