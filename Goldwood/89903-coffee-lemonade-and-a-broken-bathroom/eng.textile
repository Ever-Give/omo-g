Coffee, Lemonade, and a Broken Bathroom

Hey OmoOrg! It's been a hot minute since I posted a story here, but here's my latest endeavor 🙂

It was shaping up to be the hottest summer the town of Goldwood had experienced in several years. Outdoor events required awnings, pools were crowded, and students taking summer courses at the college carried full water bottles with them. One location benefitting from the heat wave was The Goldwood Brew. It was the premier local coffee shop in town and business typically fell off a bit in the summer when most college students were gone. As Katie prepared drinks on an early June day, she could tell this summer was going to be different.

“Fresh squeezed lemonade for Kimmy, fresh squeezed lemonade for River!” Katie called out.

“Then two iced lattes and another lemonade,” her coworker Sarah said.

“Thanks. Busy day,” Katie said as got to work preparing the first latte. The curly haired blonde was wearing her typical work attire, a Goldwood Brew t-shirt with jeans covered up by an apron. She had finished her second year of college and had been working at The Goldwood Brew for almost as long. Money was tight coming from a middle-class family where she was the middle of three sisters, all of whom were pretty smart. By taking classes in the summer, she hoped to graduate a semester early and save some financial strain for both her parents and her student loans. Her summer chemistry class was in the mornings, allowing her to work afternoon or closing shifts whenever was needed.

Katie checked her phone as the coffee machines worked their magic. She was nearly two hours into her 12-4 shift, and it felt like she had just gotten there! Being busy really did help the time go by. She continued to work, but noticed her coworker start to slow down. Sarah didn’t seem to be her regular bubbly self either.

“Everything okay Sarah?” Katie asked.

“I have to pee so freaking bad,” Sarah whispered, hands pressed into the crotch of her jeans. “I forgot to pee when I went to lunch so it’s been like 4 hours.”

Katie felt a flood of sympathy as she was no stranger to those issues herself. “Go now, hopefully it’ll stay pretty lowkey.”

“Are you sure?” Sarah asked.

“Girl, go pee,” Katie insisted.

Sarah headed around the corner as Katie worked the bar by herself for a little bit. She saw one of the customers who recently ordered sitting under a table outside, so she headed there to give him his drink. As Katie walked back, she saw a surprisingly long line for the bathrooms. One of the two bathrooms had an “out of order” sign on it leading to about ten men and women queued up. Even though it had been a few minutes, Sarah was seventh in line.

Katie headed back to the bar and took care of the remaining orders as fast as she was able. She kept her eyes out for Sarah’s return, but no one even emerged from the bathroom hallway until five minutes later. Realizing it might be a bit, Katie made herself a nitro cold brew and went to work tackling the orders as fast as she could.

“These lemonades are so good Kimmy! I can’t believe I’ve never tried one before,” River said. She and Kimmy had arrived at The Goldwood Brew with perfect timing allowing them to claim the two comfy chairs in the corner rather than just sitting at a table. As a photographer, she was a regular who often came to edit her photo spreads, sip a nice drink, and enjoy the atmosphere. It being summer meant that she could have company more often since Kimmy was a teacher.

“In fairness, the coffee is phenomenal too,” Kimmy said.

River nodded. “And the pastries. And the beer on tap… this place is basically heaven for any artists, writers, or students here.”

“Teachers too,” Kimmy grinned. “But that lesson plan I was going to do can wait till later. I’ve got all summer.”

River laughed as she fixed her straight blonde hair. “Dangerous words. Anyway, I think I’ll get another lemonade. Do you want something?”

“I’ll take an iced caramel latte,” Kimmy said.

“Ooh that does sound good,” River said. She put up their empty glasses and made her way to the line, which was decently long given the hot day. Her bladder was decently full, so she cast a glance towards the bathrooms only to find an even longer line with one of them closed. She shrugged and decided to wait till it died down.

River got to the front of the line and smiled when she saw Katie, one of the friendliest workers there. “Hey girl!”

“Hey River. Working on any cool photos?” Katie asked.

“Not really, today’s just a chill hangout day. I’m here with a teacher who’s off so we’re just catching up. You look slammed today!” River said.

“It is so busy!” Katie exclaimed. “There’s a lot of people, and one of our bathrooms is out of service. My coworker’s been in line for like twenty minutes so it’s a bit of scramble over here.”

“Oh dang,” River said.

“It’s fine! I made myself a nitro cold brew to keep up,” Katie said. She showed River her half-finished cup, shrugged, and then chugged the remainder.

“Feeling energized?” River asked.

Katie clapped her hands. “You bet. I can take on the world!”

River giggled at her antics and as she ordered before. As she waited on the drinks, she watched the bathroom line out of the corner of her eye. It really wasn't moving. Eventually Katie handed both drinks to her and River headed back.

Her second glass of lemonade was a touch sweeter than the first and tasted even better. She and Kimmy sat and talked a while longer, eventually getting a text from their friend Danielle who was bored at work. After exchanging a few messages and memes with her, River and Kimmy recalled some of the various misadventures they’d had with her over the years. After recalling an ill-fated concert, River quickly realized that laughing was the worst possible thing for her bladder.

“I will be right back Kimmy, I really have to pee,” River said before adjusting her Nike shorts and racing over to the bathroom. She grimaced as she got in line, eleven people in front of her. A few minutes later, she was joined by Sarah the barista. She was fidgeting nonstop and adjusting both her black hair and glasses.

“Ma’am are you okay?” River asked.

Sarah blushed and shook her head. “I have to pee so bad. I was in line earlier, but I waited thirty minutes and only moved four spots cause some people had to… you know. Then I felt terrible for Katie working alone so I went back to help for a bit but had to rejoin the line cause I am literally about to pee my pants right now.”

“That’s horrible! Here go in front of me,” River said hoping a few more people would overhear and let the poor girl go further. She got up to eighth before a woman said she herself was desperate and made a fuss even after the man in front of her offered to let the Sarah go in front of him and move his own spot to behind the rude woman. As Sarah conceded to the eighth spot in line, River anxiously eyed the bathroom door. It had been moving a little faster, but it was still an awfully long line.

“This could be a disaster,” River thought to herself as her own bladder twinged. “What if she can’t make it? What if I can’t make it?”

At age 24, Sarah was in uncharted territory. She’d worked long days, she’d worked stressful days, and she’d worked days where she had to hold her pee. But this day? It was the worst possible combination of all three. Technically she had wet herself as an adult before, but that was back in college after a night of drinking. She woke up the next morning to a soaked bedspread and hadn’t experienced the desperation. The hell she was going through in line was a different beast entirely.

Someone left the bathroom taking the line down to seven people. She breathed a momentary sigh of relief until realizing the bathroom’s new occupant was a desperate mom and her child who needed a diaper change. That would be five minutes at minimum. Even if everyone afterwards only had to pee, that would still be quite a long wait. She idly tugged on her hair and checked her phone. Suddenly it buzzed, which startled her causing her first leak.

Katie: I’m getting behind on orders. Your bladder comes first, but the Karens are getting cranky.

Sarah: So sorry! This line is slowww. I think I’m literally about to pee my pants. Already leaking 😭

Katie’s typing bubble went crazy for a few seconds before fading. Sarah felt a second leak escape as her eyes stayed glued to her phone.

Katie: I HAVE A PLAN!

Sarah heaved a sigh of relief. Katie walked out from behind the bar and went around the corner to the broom closet. She came back with a mop and handed it to Sarah.

“Sorry everyone. After the next person is out, we’re closing the bathroom for cleaning. It should only take about ten minutes,” Katie said.

“You’ve got to be joking!” the rude woman in front of Sarah grumbled.

“Ma’am that bathroom has been receiving twice the traffic as usual and hasn’t been cleaned all day,” Katie said.

Sarah perked up once she heard the current occupant flush and start washing up. She triumphantly walked to the front of the line, but the rude woman shoved her out of the way and locked her out.

“What a bitch,” the photographer at the end of the line said. Sarah had to agree there. The customer was in fact not always right.

The woman stayed in the bathroom a decently long time. Sarah suffered her longest leak yet and blushed as a wet spot formed and seeped into the front of her apron. “I was asleep last time. I guess now I finally find out what it’s like to wet myself as an adult,” Sarah thought. She lost two more steady leaks. By this point a dark circle had formed on her apron and warm pee trickled down the legs of her jeans.

The door opened and the woman wordlessly walked out a brisk pace. Sarah wheeled the mop cart inside and slammed the door. Her dam was already breaking as she ripped her jeans down and lifted her apron up. She unleashed a massive torrent into the toilet for at least a minute straight. The relief was truly felt orgasmic.

“Was it?” The thought came out of nowhere, but her long pee did feel awfully good. Perhaps she would investigate after work. Ultimately, about two thirds of her bladder made it into the toilet. She felt pretty embarrassed but knew it could have been a whole lot worse. She mopped the bathroom and dabbed up some spilt coffee with a paper towel. Sarah went to dispose of it and was caught off guard as the trash can absolutely reeked. She took the bag out and found a pair of panties at the bottom absolutely soaked. As Sarah thought back to the uncharacteristically quiet exit from the woman before her, she couldn’t help but laugh. “Serves you right.”

A knock on the door jolted Sarah back to reality. “Hey, I know you’re cleaning, but can you please hurry up?” A woman said.

“The other customers!” Sarah frantically shoved the mop back in her cart and made her out of the bathroom as the desperate woman ran in. As she watched several desperate customers stand in line, she hoped the pace would finally pick up.

She returned to the bar and found Katie bouncing in a dozen different directions at once as she took, made, and handed out orders. The blonde girl slipped a list of names and orders to her before grabbing two glasses and taking them to customers sitting outside. “Thank goodness you’re back!” Katie said.

“I’m so sorry for that wait! I’ll get right back to work!” Sarah stammered as she began to make the next drink.

Katie handed off both drinks and darted back inside. After chugging her nitro cold brew, her brain had shifted in a gear she’d previously only experienced in the last five minutes of exams. It wasn’t her only body part working in overdrive though.

She walked back inside and checked out the bathroom line. It certainly hadn’t gotten any shorter. She made eye contact with River whose knees were bent as she smiled through the pain. A quick glance at her phone said she still had forty-five minutes left of her shift. While Katie was glad Sarah got her chance to pee, she’d been counting on saving the bathroom cleaning idea for herself. That was okay though. Her bladder would put up a fight, but it was a fight she could win.

*004*2023-06-21 03:20

As much as it pained River to admit it, she was entering familiar territory as her bladder began to leak. Within the past year were a dangerously close call at a concert followed by a full wetting in a Halloween maze. She hoped she'd avoid another accident, but it wasn't looking good.

The bathroom door opened followed by a very relieved woman walking out. River became second in line, but still didn’t know if that would be enough time. Her next leak was twice as long as the previous one forming a small damp patch on her shorts. Several drops ran down each of her crossed legs. She tried to spread them apart but that just caused two more leaks.

“I can make it. I can make it.” River told herself.

“Plumbing!” A mustached man shouted as he entered the coffeeshop. Katie directed him and he entered the broken bathroom. It seemed the line had been gifted a guardian angel.

The man in front of River entered the bathroom. Suddenly, there was a clattering of tools from inside the broken bathroom as the plumber swore. He came out having been splashed several times. “There’s a leak in there that just burst open. We’re going to have to shut the water off for about thirty minutes to contain it.”

River’s jaw dropped. There was no way she could last three minutes let alone thirty. She got out of line and tried to make her way back to Kimmy, leaking pee with each step. She couldn’t even turn the corner before her bladder burst. She was holding on and then suddenly there was nothing to hold on to. Her light blue Nike shorts turned several shades darker as River sighed and conceded defeat. She spread her legs as her stream no longer had any resistance and cascaded to the floor below. She was wetting herself in one of her favorite public establishments. It was a humiliating thought, yet she in the moment she was just happy to finally let go. A few moments later she was found by a startled Kimmy.

“Oh no!” Kimmy exclaimed.

“That’s not the outcome I wanted, but it’s fine,” River said.

“Are you sure?” Kimmy asked.

“You ask that like I’m a stranger to this predicament,” River said. She walked out into the main part of the cafe and received a handful of stares and sympathetic faces from the other patrons. She felt herself blushing as she made her way to the bar. While she was growing used to situations like that, the embarrassment never fully went away either.

The pouring of lemonade taunted Katie’s poor distended bladder as she stood behind the bar with crossed legs. Her first leak had already sprung and a second one came as she handed a man his drink. She looked down and pretended that she didn’t see the golf ball sized stain on her apron threatening to expand. She was in the middle of mentally giving her bladder a pep talk when River approached her.

“Hey Katie… um…”

Katie looked up and gasped. River's shorts were soaked. “I’m so sorry! This is a disaster. Sarah, could you get the mop and… shit!”

She let out a leak for several seconds before frantically managing to clamp down on her leaky bladder. Awkward eye contact with River confirmed that she’d seen the entire thing.

“When does your shift end?” River asked.

“Ten minutes. She can leave early!” Sarah insisted. “Just get her out of here!”

“Thank you so much!” Katie shouted. She scrambled to the door with River and Kimmy following close behind her. The Goldwood Brew was across from a strip center in downtown, but Katie knew most of those stores were locally owned with odd hours and often lacked public bathrooms.

“Where to?” River asked.

“I have no idea! We just have to hope for the best,” Katie said as she sprinted across the crosswalk spraying into her already drenched panties.

“Is that ice cream shop open?” Kimmy asked.

“It should be. You’re a lifesaver!” Katie shouted.

Katie had been meaning to try out Chilly Swirls for a few months, but this certainly wasn’t the occasion she had in mind. The ice cream parlor was mostly empty with a single employee behind the counter. She violently threw open the door and asked where the bathroom was.

Though the guy behind the counter nicely pointed to the back corner, it didn’t matter. Katie lost complete control of her bladder before she even made it off the entrance mat. She covered her mouth and watched helplessly a golden torrent spilled down her legs. Her panties, jeans, apron, and even part of her shirt became soaked in warm pee which ultimately pooled onto the floor in a massive puddle. Katie was absolutely mortified. Despite recurring bedwetting issues growing up, her only adult wettings had occurred relatively privately on a flight where only her sister noticed. This was worse in every possible way.

Katie brushed a few tears away and awkwardly approached the employee, a college aged guy with black hair and a neat beard named Mark. “I’m so sorry. I’ll go clean up a bit.”

She headed to the bathroom and splashed water on her pants before spending several minutes in front of the hand dryer at various angles. Once she concluded that it was as good as it would get, she took a deep breath and walked out. Mark was mopping up the entrance while River and Kimmy made small talk about the bathroom nightmare that had unfolded at Goldwood Brew.

“Hey, are you doing okay?” River asked.

“I’m beyond embarrassed but I’ve accepted it,” Katie said. “Sorry again, Mark.”

“Accidents happen,” Mark shrugged. He abandoned the mop and walked behind the counter. “Have a favorite flavor?”

“Cookie dough,” Katie said.

“Good choice,” Mark said. He made her a cup and handed it to her. Katie offered to pay, but Mark insisted it was on the house.

Katie thanked him as she walked back to Goldwood Brew with River and Kimmy. “I feel so bad, but thankfully he was nice about it.”

“Yeah, he seems like a good dude,” River said.

“Definitely. You two have been awesome too,” Katie said. The three girls headed back to The Goldwood Brew where they ate their ice cream in the parking lot. River and Kimmy left and Katie prepared herself for an uncomfortable and smelly drive home. She arrived at an empty apartment where she immediately did laundry and told her sister a watered down version of the Chilly Swirls incident that left out her accident.

For the rest of that night, Katie found herself unable to get Mark out of her head. He had been so comforting to a stranger going through one of her most humiliating moments. Over the next few weeks, she debated about going back to Chilly Swirls but couldn’t do it. She finished her summer chemistry class, and her family went on vacation. She returned to Goldwood eager for her biology class in the second summer session as she preferred it to chemistry.

She walked into the lecture hall and found herself in an assigned seat right next to Mark.
