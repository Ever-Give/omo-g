Shooting Hoops and Soaking Pants

Hey Omo Org! I wanted to write a basketball story in honor of March Madness. This one is primarily regular omo in terms of desperation/wetting, but let's just say it also has some ties to a certain story that's currently blowing up in the Omutsu section 🙂

Danielle entered the kitchen to the sound of David humming and drumming on the countertops as he cooked dinner. Beef sizzled in the skillet while peppers and onions were being sautéed in the next pan over.

“You’re in a good mood today,” Danielle said after he kissed her.

“Yep! We haven’t had a chance to get the group out to do something lately, but Ronnie just scored some free tickets to the Goldwood College women’s basketball that game he's announcing.”

“I totally forgot basketball was going on. But I’d love to go.”

“You sure?”

Danielle nodded. “I’m slowly assimilating into a sportsball fan. This should be fun!”

She hit up the group chat and plans essentially became a triple date. Her best friend Emily and her boyfriend Dylan were down, while Ronnie’s girlfriend Vanessa was already planning to go support her man. It became a quadruple date after dinner when River mentioned her not-quite-official-girlfriend Clara would be there covering the game for her news job.

“Should be a great time,” David said as Emily and Ronnie spammed the chat with beaver emojis in honor of their alma mater.

“Absolutely. Emily’s asking who they’re playing and if they’re good.”

“Weathersby University. They’re new to the conference this year, but they got a player named Freya Henrickson from Sweden who’s an absolute monster.”

“And how’s Goldwood?”

“We’re doing good. Missing some graduates from last year’s team, but Angelica Walker is getting some WNBA buzz. It’ll be tight, but I’ve got the Beavs.”

“Go Beavs,” Danielle said as David relayed that to the group chat.

Another message came through and Danielle laughed as Emily declared “We’ll win and then celebrate by getting kicked out of Ikea!”

“She’s joking… right?” David asked.

Danielle laughed. “I guess we’ll find out on Friday.”

“I just hope the bathroom situation plays out better than our last trip to Goldwood Colosseum," David said.

Danielle blushed as memories of the infamous concert that left her in soaked jeans and awakened a new fetish came rushing back. "Do you really though?"

David winked. “No, not really.”

Freya was about to piss herself. The foul she’d taken from Naomi Le had nearly knocked her to the ground while unleashing a hot jet of piss into her already damp Poise shield. She steadied herself, fully aware that had she hit the ground, she’d have soaked herself completely. She grit her teeth and walked to the free throw line. After a test dribble, she shot, a small leak escaping.

She completely bricked it. “Come on Henrickson!” Coach Montgomery yelled.

Freya took a deep breath determined not to let her down. Coach Monty was intense, but that also made her the most successful coach Weathersby had had in years. She shook off her nerves and screaming bladder before drilling her follow up shot.

“Much better!” Coach Monty cheered as Freya high fived her teammates.

“Needed that, subbing out,” Freya said before bolting to the locker room. She reached the stalls and yanked her shorts down before unleashing a massive torrent. As she peed, she blushed at the realization that she’d been so desperate she hadn’t even shut the stall door. While she was a gifted athlete, Freya was also cursed with an incredibly small bladder that led to a medical incontinence diagnosis in her early teens. She’d been iffy about going abroad for basketball until she found out about an all girls dorm for incontinent students at Weathersby U. Only a select few teammates officially knew, but she suspected others were suspicious given her ability to sub herself out at any time for a bathroom break. While Coach Montgomery was a “tough, old school” coach, her endorsement was clear.

“I’ll accommodate whatever you need, and you’ll pay us back on the court,” coach had said that summer. Freya took it to heart, emerging as the leading scorer.

She washed her hands and headed back out to the court. The scrimmage was almost over, but she hoped to log a few more minutes. It was the last practice before they got their biggest win of the season by kicking Goldwood’s ass.

Took longer than intended, but here's part 2!

“Come in!” Emily shouted from inside as Danielle and David arrived. Danielle was met by a sight that had been familiar in college and rarer as adults. Emily stood at the table proudly stirring a punch bowl of her infamous “Emily Elixir”. Emily, a petite Asian girl, stood in grey leggings and one of Danielle’s old Goldwood College shirts that no longer fit her. Her boyfriend Dylan had black hair and had recently grown a beard. He towered a whole foot over her, but was a perfect laid back guy to balance out Emily’s chaos. Plus one time Danielle got to watch Emily stand on a stood to argue with him.

Through the open door of the bathroom, Danielle saw River painting Vanessa’s face. River’s seemingly everchanging hair was currently black and gold to match their alma mater’s colors, with a “G” painted on one cheek and a “C” on the other. Her current handiwork was painting a beaver on Vanessa’s face. Vanessa was a tall brunette with freckles and friendly smile. Danielle had met her at the infamous concert and the rest was history.

Danielle smiled as Emily stirred her punch like a witch with a cauldron. “Now Em, we’re going to a basketball game, not a rave.”

“Oh trust me, this thing is way weaker than it used to be. Remember when we drank too much of a stronger mix and all pissed ourselves at the concert?”

“That was like a year ago.”

Emily cleared her throat and flipped her hair, speaking in a “posh” accent. “I have become a more mature and sophisticated woman since then.”

Danielle and David both laughed as Emily flipped them off. Dylan poured a cup and nodded in approval. “An exquisite and refined cocktail, my lady.”

Emily offered a cup and Danielle drank. It was nice and fruity without a super strong taste of alcohol. “What’s in it this time?”

Emily beamed. “As always, the secret ingredient is love.”

“And Everclear,” River said as she emerged from the bathroom and hugged Danielle.

“You look great as ever, Riv. How’s Clara?” Danielle asked.

“Doing great! She hasn’t had an accident for two weeks and the pants she wanted to wear are a bit snug so she’s forgoing diapers tonight.”

“Good for her!” Danielle said.

“Yeah. She’s definitely been feeling more confident lately,” River said with a blush.

Emily walked over with two solo cups. “Emily Elixir?”

“Bottoms up!” River said.

Danielle treated herself to a cup and entered the living room. The guys had put on the men’s away game, so the group visited and drank Emily Elixir with about an hour till they had to leave. Danielle felt her bladder fill and the timing worked out almost perfectly. She grew desperate about ten minutes before leaving and unleashed a massive torrent into Emily’s toilet before heading out.

It was a short drive to the Willis K. Goldwood Colosseum. Danielle had only been a few times since walking across that stage at graduation, but each trip for a concert or sporting event felt like she was reliving her college years, not that they were particularly far behind her. She wasn’t sure how big of a crowd to expect, but it was nearly packed. Goldwood and Weathersby were projected to play for the Yellow Valley Conference’s title so the stakes were high, even for a regular season game. They found their seats and River beamed as Clara appeared on the jumbotron. The flame haired reporter wore a cute black top and white jeans. It was a bold choice for someone who’d often struggled with incontinence, but Danielle couldn’t help feeling proud. Clara was a sweetheart who looked both stunning and confident. No one deserved to rock that look more.

While Clara wasn’t particularly short, she was dwarfed by the player standing next to her. Angelica Walker was a beautiful and muscular black girl who’d been the Lady Beavers’ star player for the past four years. As she answered Clara’s questions, her demeanor of a stone cold killer was unmistakable even to someone like Danielle who wasn’t big into sports. When asked about a tweet from one of the Weathersby players, Angelica’s answer of “She can talk shit, I’ll do my talking on the court” produced an electric reaction from the fans. The energy was amped up further as two more players appeared. One was Angelica’s sister Amber and the other was a brunette named Piper White. Together the trio surrounding Clara had been known as the White Walkers. It would’ve been cooler if the last season of Game of Thrones wasn’t a complete dumpster fire, but it was a fun name regardless.

With time to kill before tip off, Danielle accepted Emily and Vanessa’s invitation to buy concessions. She bought nachos to split with David while grabbing some popcorn for River. As Danielle waited in line, she felt her bladder steadily refilling. She was far from desperate, but Emily caught her gaze lingering on the bathroom for a second too long.

“Does someone already have to pee again?” Emily teased.

“I’m just scouting in case I need to go at half time,” Danielle lied.

Emily shot Vanessa a mischievous grin. “The only thing worse than Dani’s bladder control is her lying. Don’t you agree?”

Vanessa laughed. “Dani, do what you’ve gotta do. I’m still lowkey scarred from pissing myself here at that concert so I’m sure not judging.”

Danielle was just about to have her friends hold her spot while she “went to be safe” when a familiar face walked by.

“Look who made it!” Ronnie said giving Vanessa a hug.

“You’re going to absolutely crush calling this game,” Vanessa said.

“Ditto. And thanks again for the tickets,” Danielle said. As nice as Ronnie was, she wound up stuck in small talk as the line moved. By the time Ronnie had to be back up in the booth, Danielle was buying food with not enough hands for just Emily and Vanessa to hold everything while she peed.

“I’ll wait till later,” Danielle decided. As they headed back down to their seats, she could’ve sworn she saw Vanessa eyeing the bathrooms too. She made a mental note to ask her at half time and the next thing she new the game was tipping off.

Despite being in the middle of a career year, Freya found herself nervous as Goldwood took the ball for the opening possession. One of the first things she’d learned about American sports culture was that truly great teams or units had nicknames, and the White Walker offense was no exception. Her teammate Naomi blocked a pass from Piper just for Freya to get outmuscled by Angelica as she grabbed the ball in midair to prevent the turnover. Freya had always been better on offense than defense, and Angelica had both the height and weight advantage on her. It was going to be a long day.

Goldwood got out to an early lead. Angelica passed to Piper for an easy bucket and Weathersby failed to score on their first offensive possession when Freya’s shot hit the rim and Piper White rebounded before passing it to Amber who drained a three. 5-0 Goldwood.

As the crowd cheered, Freya felt a familiar sensation down in her bladder. She didn’t remember drinking that much water during warmups, but nerves always heightened her need to pee. She subtly adjusted her shorts which contained her usual Poise pad that she could leak into if needed. After a rough opening few minutes that saw Weathersby's deficit stretch to 9-2, Freya snatched a rebound from Piper and ran down the court for a dunk. The visiting crowd loved it, blissfully unaware that Freya felt pee leak out of her bladder as she came back down. A few plays later, her teammate Kimberly got fouled and made both of her free throws. Freya gave her a high five as Coach Montgomery cheered. They were getting momentum. Her urge to pee was growing, but she wasn’t going to risk messing up the game plan by subbing out when her team was rolling. She stayed in for a few more minutes, largely unbothered by her bladder until she got tripped up and hit the ground drawing a foul against Angelica.

Freya stayed down for a few seconds, in pain not from the hit but from her bladder. She had lost a much longer spurt than she had on the dunk with a decent amount of pee pooled up in her Poise. She got up, bladder feeling like it was about to explode. She looked down and saw a faint wet spot visible on her shorts. Thankfully her team’s jerseys were dark purple.

“Foul on Walker. Henrickson to the line,” said the announcer as the home crowd booed. Freya nailed her first shot but the second was a devastating miss. Not only did she cost her team a point, Angelica snagged the rebound and Freya had to stay out for another sequence on defense. She finally caught coach Monty’s eyes and headed back to the locker room.

Once she was inside, Freya sprinted to the closest stall. Pee leaked down her legs and by the she reached the toilet, her pad was overflowing and her shorts and underwear were soaked. Coming that close to a full accident on court was mortifying, but she had to get back in the game as soon as possible. She headed to her locker and wiped herself down before changing into fresh underwear and shorts. She kept an extra set clean for a reason after all.

The first quarter ended and before Danielle could get up to go pee, Clara walked out on the court for a quick sideline interview with Goldwood’s Coach Jennings. Danielle stayed put, happy to support her relatively new friend, but watching the interview meant a line for the bathroom that was already out the door. She grimaced and remained seated while noticing River squirm and Vanessa tap her foot. She had just watched Freya miss her second free throw before playing a little defense and running off the court. Weathersby's star player had looked nervous shooting and her awkward sprint to the locker room was a situation Danielle knew all too well. “She’s about to piss herself." Focusing on Freya’s state only reminded her of her own bladder. A small stream of pee escaped and Danielle jolted upright in her seat.

“Need to piss. Bad.” David winked at her and her face turned crimson, but thankfully she had company.

“Oh thank God. Was debating for a long ass time,” Vanessa said.

“Girl, same,” River said.

“And this, children is why we never learn our lessons,” Emily ribbed.

“Yeah yeah, we can't all have steel bladders like you,” Danielle said before flipping her off while Emily held up heart hands. She, River, and Vanessa wove through the crowd just in time to see a wet floor sign in front of both the men’s and women’s bathrooms.

“Everyone stay back,” a maintenance worker said while shooing away disappointed spectators.

Danielle pushed her way to the front of the small crowd, losing a second leak in the process. “What happened?”

“Pipe burst and we had to cut the water off.”

Danielle’s stomach dropped as she felt another trickle of pee, a few drops now sliding down her leg. “For the whole colosseum?”

“Yep. Sorry ma’am.”

“When will it be fixed?” Vanessa asked, nearly hopping in place.

“Tough to give an exact estimate, but an hour maybe?”

“Okay. Sorry to bother you,” Danielle said. Her whole body trembled and her friends looked equally desperate. She had a sinking feeling that history was about to repeat itself in Goldwood Colosseum.
