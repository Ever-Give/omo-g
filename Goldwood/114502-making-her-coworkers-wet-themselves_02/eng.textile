Hmm... interesting theory 👀

She's only in Diaper Dorm (at least for now) but she might get a spin off later. I really like her.

Week 2: Monday

Izzy’s Day

Izzy was back in college, her senior physics class to be precise. It was one of the hardest classes she took and the final was that day. She opened her exam book and was frustrated when she didn’t remember any of it. Then she felt a jolt in her bladder and looked around. Dr. O’Connor was a strict professor and she doubted she’d get a bathroom break. Next to her, Mark, Kara, and Stuart scribbled away while Gemma rocked back and forth. It looked like she was about to burst too. Izzy returned to her exam and leaked.

“I’m about to have an accident. And it’s too important of an exam to turn in early and try to save my bladder.”

Another spurt escaped. Then another. Then Gemma peed herself a few seats over. That proved too much for her bladder to handle and she lost control. Warmth soaked through her panties and jeans as pee pooled in her chair before spilling onto the floor.

Drip. Drip. Drop.

The alarm blared. Izzy’s head was in a fog but it only took a few seconds for her to feel the unthinkable. Her bed was very warm and very wet.

“Fuck!”

Felix darted off a dry corner of the bed as Izzy stumbled to her feet. Her leggings were soaked as was the base of her oversized sleep shirt. She reached into her panties and felt the saturation, burning with a mix of shame and arousal. “I wanted to wet myself more, but not like this!”

Izzy ripped off her wet clothes and found the empty glass of water and can of tea on her bedside table. She had way too much to drink the night before. Perhaps she should have seen it coming. It’d be an interesting experience to potentially write about on YellowFlow, but first she just really needed to shower and start a load of laundry. Her mattress was completely stained and currently reeked of piss. She tossed the sheets in the washing machine followed by her soaked clothes. Then she took a very refreshing shower then started the washing machine. Her apartment was close enough that she could come home for lunch and move her mess to the dryer. She was late before she even left the apartment. Izzy did a shitty parking job once she arrived and cut off Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own” midsentence.

8:16. Could this day be any worse?

She walked in and was thankfully welcomed by smiling coworkers. Kara looked up from her donut, shocked that she was even later than Mark.

“Rough morning,” Izzy said.

Kara frowned. “Everything okay? It sounded like yesterday was better.”

“I’m fine,” Izzy said, more defensively than she intended. “Just didn’t sleep well. But Gemma brought donuts so that should help.”

“Oh for sure,” Kara said.

Izzy headed to her room of the office where Mark and Gemma were already talking, laughing even. Mark turned around as soon as he heard her footsteps. “Look who decided to join us!”

“We can’t all be perfectly punctual like you,” Izzy said.

“Well, hope you’re doing better,” Gemma said. “Donuts in the breakroom as promised. And here’s a little pick me up.”

She slid over a bottle of Starbucks coffee, presumably from the donut shop. “Thanks Gemma! I’ve got a 9 A.M. call with Stuart, so that’ll be the perfect treat afterwards. Can’t pull an Izzy on the phone with the client!”

“Or a Gemma,” Mark said.

Gemma folded her arms. “Rude!” She pretended to be mad at him, something that Izzy certainly hadn’t seen from her the previous week. Perhaps she was just getting more comfortable. Izzy walked to the fridge and set down her iced coffee to keep it cold. She did a double take as someone else had the same size and flavor, so she set hers on the second shelf above the other bottle.

She returned to her room and paused in the doorway. Mark and Gemma made eye contact from across the room but didn’t say anything. Gemma had downed a big chunk of her water jug in addition to some coffee and was soon tapping her foot. Izzy watched from the corner of her eye, expecting her to pee at any minute. Gemma instead remained firm at her desk until Izzy took Stuart’s call and had to fully focus on work. After hanging up on Stuart, she smiled at the click of heels as Helen, a tall brunette with glasses who worked in IT, walked by. The bathroom door shut, but Izzy was met by déjà vu an hour later.

“How are you?” Izzy asked Helen.

“Doing great! Just here doing some work on the server. And apparently I drank way too much coffee this morning,” Helen said with a laugh.

“Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt,” Izzy said as Helen rounded the corner. Then she got up herself and took her coffee out of the fridge’s bottom shelf.

Before long it was time for the weekly call with TerraCorp. Izzy headed to the bathroom to avoid a repeat of the previous Monday’s disaster and sat down in the conference room with her notes. It felt good to actually focus on work rather than her exploding bladder. Jacob came in followed by Mark and Gemma, who was observing that week. As Jacob’s mouse died and he left to grab batteries, Gemma giggled softly to Mark. “I really have to pee.”

“Rookie mistake,” Mark said.

“Do you need to step out?” Izzy whispered.

“I’m fine. Live and learn,” Gemma said.

The meeting would’ve been perfectly normal if not for Gemma. She was clearly desperate to pee and Izzy had a hard time focusing when it wasn’t her turn to speak. Several times she could’ve sworn she saw Gemma and Mark trade knowing glances when Jacob looked away.

“Am I… jealous?” Izzy pinched herself. She had never been the jealous type, and she and Mark had danced awkwardly around each other for three years. Why would it matter if Gemma was into him? Or he was into her? Izzy returned to her desk and texted Kara as Gemma raced to the bathroom.

Izzy: Is it just me, or are Mark and Gemma flirty this morning?

Kara: Whaaat??? Omw to investigate

Kara walked over to chat and Izzy got up to remove herself from the conversation. She stopped by the break room for a 2nd donut when she heard the frantic clicking of heels. Helen power walked around the corner mumbling under her breath. Rather than grabbing seconds, Izzy suddenly decided that she had to pee. She entered the hallway and saw Helen make it few steps further, knees shaking. Then she froze in place and desperately grabbed herself as if it would do any good. There was already a wet spot on Helen’s cream skirt and in a now familiar sight, she gasped, stammered “please no!” and watched helplessly as her wet spot expanded and pee gushed down her legs. Then she noticed Izzy.

“What the fuck am I doing?” Izzy thought as she snapped herself out of her daze. She was enjoying someone else’s accident! Even if it was hot, even if she had nothing to do with it, it suddenly felt very wrong. Both women made horrified eye contact and Izzy tripped over her words before struggling to say “It’ll be okay.”

Helen blushed. “Sweet thought, but no. I pissed myself at 32! What the hell is wrong with me? I was a little squirmy as I worked on the server but suddenly… I don’t even know.”

“Helen. I did the same thing last week.”

Helen held a hand to her chest. “Are you for real?”

Izzy nodded and explained her previous Monday’s debacle. A text came through midway through the story, but she put it off as she found the mop from the closet and Helen escaped out the side door. She heard footsteps and turned around to see Gemma.

“Hey, can you go around? Helen got sick and I’m cleaning.”

“Oh no! Hope she feels better,” Gemma said. She headed back to her desk and Izzy checked her phone.

Kara: There’s definitely something there

Izzy sighed, ashamed at how bad that made her feel. She had a three years to commit to asking Mark out but couldn’t do it. Mark deserved better than a scared girl with a weird fetish anyway.

Mark’s Day

Mark sat up in bed after barely sleeping the night before. He and Gemma were about to play a game, and he was already rock hard at the thought of it. There was only one rule: Gemma had to text Mark and ask him to use the bathroom. Denying her requests was encouraged. If it worked, they could experiment with adding more rules later. He showered, ate breakfast and didn’t even feel the urge to check YellowFlow with the game about to unfold. He did a double at the clock as he parked and finished the rest of Foreigner’s “Feels Like the First Time”.

7:53. Could this day be any better?

He walked inside and found Gemma waiting at her desk. “Holy fuck. You’re early!”

Mark shrugged. “Guess I was just itching to get here for some reason.” He looked over at Gemma’s desk. She had an iced coffee in addition to her giant water jug. He couldn't tell how on board Gemma was with his kink, but she was certainly curious. “You might be playing with fire there.”

Gemma leaned back in her chair and Mark noticed most buttons on her blouse were undone. “Maybe I am.”

“Is what you texted about growing up the reason why you drink so much water?” Mark asked. It was an awfully personal question, but they’d have plenty of time to go absolutely feral later.

“Partially. I am just really into fitness in general, but yeah. Good to prove to my body I can handle it.”

“Two accidents in a week says otherwise,” Mark thought, but he wasn’t going to say it out loud. “That makes sense. I guess just get working on that water and we’ll go from there.”

“That’s the plan,” Gemma said. She fastened her blouse back up but as eight came and went, the pair looked around.

“No clue where Izzy is,” Mark said.

“I hope she’s well. I bought donuts for her,” Gemma said. She explained how Izzy wanted something for everyone and for a second Mark felt a bit bad. Izzy was really sweet. But Audrey was right. Why not take a chance on Gemma and see where it goes? His phone buzzed.

Gemma: Can I use the bathroom?

Mark traded a grin with her from across the room. And replied.

Mark: No. You should have gone before work.

He felt his cock harden even though he doubted Gemma was actually desperate. It thrilled him all the same.

It was well after 8 when Izzy finally arrived. The pair sassed each other now that she was finally late and Mark found himself wondering if there was more to her nondescript “rough morning” comment. Gemma gave Izzy some coffee to go with her donuts and met Helen for the first time. Izzy took a call from Stuart and Jacob told Gemma she could sit in on the TerraCorp call. It was an unexpectedly busy morning. Gemma texted Mark again at 9:30 and he denied permission. Now it seemed that she was starting to get desperate, twirling the ends of her hair and tapping her foot. Mark got another text at ten, not a bathroom break to deny, but a question.

Gemma: This is going where I think it’s going, isn’t it?

Mark: maybe?

She asked for a break at 10:25 and Mark told her no as Izzy got up to pee. He, Gemma, Izzy, and Jacob headed into the conference room. As Jacob’s mouse died and he left to grab batteries, Gemma giggled softly to Mark. “I really have to pee.”

Mark felt like he was sweating as he tried his hardest to keep his composure. He was thankful to be seated, though he nearly came at the thought of Gemma reaching her hand over his crotch. Thankfully, the pair remained about as professional as two coworkers secretively playing a kinky game could be. “Rookie mistake,” Mark said nonchalantly.

“Do you need to step out?” Izzy whispered.

“I’m fine. Live and learn,” Gemma said.

Gemma certainly had a lot of living and learning to do as that week’s call took up the whole scheduled hour. Mark kept her in the corner of his eye as her lower half was practically dancing beneath the table. He was pleasantly surprised by how well he was able to focus and only had to ask the client to repeat one question. As they left the conference room, Mark snuck a quick glance at Gemma. A small wet patch was faintly visible on her light gray slacks. They got back to their desks and she texted him.

Gemma: Can I go now? It’s an emergency.

Mark wanted to deny her so, so badly, but held off. She had to end up liking this kink after all. Then a he thought of the perfect twist.

Mark: Yes. You have one more bathroom pass for the day.

For a nervous few seconds he wondered if his new additional rule was unwelcome. Gemma simply read the text and bolted to the bathroom. A few minutes later she replied back.

Gemma: Made it 😊

Gemma: And if I only use one bathroom pass today, I get to have a 3rd next time.

“Next time. She is enjoying this.”

Mark headed to the men’s room and took care of a different need. She was fully onboard. It was going even better than he hoped.

Mark: Do you think you’ll only need one today?

Gemma: Almost certainly not

Gemma walked back into the room and the pair traded glances. There was a lot unsaid as Kara walked over and they pulled themselves out of their game. Gemma and Kara talked about workout routines as Izzy got up and walked around the corner. Mark chimed in occasionally, but was mainly more interested in seeing how soon it would be till Gemma had to pee again. She got up a few minutes later as Mark half assed some excel work for TerraCorp.

Gemma sat back down, but something seemed odd. “Yes?” Mark asked.

“Oh, the IT lady, Helen I think, went home sick. Izzy’s cleaning up the hallway. Hope there’s not a bug going around.”

“That would be rough before that big meeting,” Mark said.

Gemma nodded and unconvincingly pretended to work until the DoorDash Mark ordered from the deli down the street arrived. Mark had agreed to pay, but bought her a huge iced tea as a surprise. He set the cup down and Gemma side eyed him as she pulled her phone out.

Gemma: How thoughtful

Mark: I’m nothing if not a gentleman

Gemma: Can I use the bathroom, gentleman?

Mark: Negative, Ghost Rider

They ate lunch and had a nice surface level conversation while waging their game through texts and expressions. By 1:00 Gemma was already desperate again, even with her tea still half full. She asked for permission and Mark denied her, telling her to wait until two. They got back to work and Mark kept her in the corner of his vision. The afternoon remained just as slow as the morning and soon some texts started rolling in.

1:21 Gemma: Hi can I pee

1:22 Mark: No

1:37 Gemma: Pretty please?

1:38 Mark: No

1:44 Gemma: Maaaaark

1:45 Mark: Ask one more time and you have to wait till 2:10

1:46 Gemma: Rude!

Mark could barely focus and had to totally recalibrate for a second as Kara walked around the corner with a question. She laughed as he asked her to repeat the question.

“Workin’ hard or hardly workin?” Kara teased.

“He’s working just as hard as usual,” Gemma butted in. Both girls high fived and Mark shook his head. He caught Izzy in the fringe of his vision, seemingly on the fence about joining in.

“I have been a great influence on Gemma, thank you very much,” Mark said.

“He has,” Gemma said. She shifted in her seat and sat on her foot with enough notice to draw Kara’s attention.

“You good?” Kara asked.

“Yeah. I uh… I’ve just been putting a bathroom trip off a little too long. I’ll go now before I pull an Izzy!”

Izzy didn’t react much beyond a slight smile as Gemma got up. Kara left as well and Mark turned to her. “How’s it going, Iz?”

“It’s going.”

Mark paused, unaccustomed to seeing her so defeated. “What happened? I know you said it was a rough morning.”

“I uh… I tried to sit on the bed and drink my coffee for some reason. Felix jumped on me and it spilled everywhere, clothes and sheets included.”

“Yeah, that’ll start off your week weird,” Mark said.

Izzy nodded, still seeming a bit down. As neither went back to work, Mark asked something he probably should have clarified sooner. “Do you want us to retire ‘pulling an Izzy’?”

“No. It’s a funny little bit that lets us laugh off something humiliating, but thanks for asking,” Izzy said. Mark’s phone buzzed in his pocket, but he ignored it as Izzy looked like she was debating saying more. “I saw someone else pull an Izzy,” she whispered.

Mark froze. “Did she notice Gemma’s wet spot on the TerraCorp call?”

“Who?” he asked as his phone buzzed again.

“Helen. She went home sick for the same reason I did.” Mark’s jaw dropped, having completely missed yet another accident. Then Izzy reddened. “I shouldn’t have said that!”

“It’s fine,” I’m not going to tell,” Mark said. Izzy remained flustered and he reiterated it wasn’t a big deal. The pair turned back to their work and Mark checked his phone. It was 2:09 and a third text had just came in.

Gemma: Mark! You there? You never officially gave me permission!

Mark: Oh shit! You can go. Assuming you haven’t gone in your pants yet.

Gemma: Only a little 😊

Mark went rock hard and positioned his lap as far away from Izzy’s eyesight as possible. He pinched himself just to make sure he wasn’t dreaming, but it was very much real. Another text came through.

Gemma: Fake a phone call

Mark did just that as he headed out to the parking lot. Gemma waited around the corner. “Sorry about that.”

“Get stuck doing your actual job?”

“Yeah,” Mark lied.

“Well you answered in the nick of time,” Gemma said. She smoothed her slacks and there was a definite wet spot.

“How wet?”

“I leaked a few times,” Gemma admitted. “That tea went straight through me.”

Mark reached out. “Can I?”

Gemma laughed. “We’re at work, pervert.”

“Fair,” Mark said. He headed back inside while Gemma walked a lap of the building. He received another text after replying to a few loose emails and sorting files to act productive.

3:12 Gemma: I know you said I had two passes, but I really don’t think I can last till 5

Mark paused, careful to make sure she still enjoyed it

3:15 Mark: How about you try, but we have a safe word

3:17 Gemma: What if I “go home with a migraine”?

3:18 Mark: If you want to. I assume you don’t want to piss yourself at work in back-to-back weeks.

3:19 Gemma: As hot as that sounds, no

At 3:27, Gemma texted that she was already leaking. At 3:31, she emailed Jacob and grabbed her stuff to leave.

Then came the text he’d been waiting for

3:35 Gemma: Barely made it to the car before flooding.

3:35 Mark: Pics or it didn’t happen

Gemma’s typing bubble appeared, but she didn’t send any pictures. She sent her address.

Gemma’s Day

9 to 5 blared a few minutes earlier than usual as Gemma made time for a trip to the donut shop. As she showered and dressed, it was hard to believe she was already so close to snagging Mark. She quivered at the thought of the upcoming game as she grabbed her essentials, including a vial of diuretics. It had been fun to try them during the run and she still had a good bit left. She drove to the donut shop and picked up a dozen donuts followed by iced coffees for herself and Izzy. A few drops of diuretic into Izzy's coffee later, Gemma left for work. She parked to the tune of "Taste" by Sabrina Carpenter and powered off the car.

7:47 Could this day be any better?

Gemma headed inside and sent a quick officewide email announcing the donuts in the breakroom. She heard footsteps and did a double take as she recognized Mark’s footsteps. She undid a few buttons on her blouse and turned around. “Holy fuck. You’re early!”

Mark shrugged. “Guess I was just itching to get here for some reason.” He looked over at Gemma’s iced coffee and water jug. “You might be playing with fire there.”

Gemma flashed her most devious smile. “Maybe I am.”

“Is what you texted about growing up why you drink so much water?” Mark asked.

It wasn’t the direction she expected the conversation to go early, but Gemma answered all the same. “Partially. I am just really into fitness in general, but yeah. Good to prove to my body I can handle it.”

“That makes sense. I guess just get working on that water and we’ll go from there.”

As eight came and went, both coworkers noted Izzy’s absence. It felt odd, but that made it a bit easier to warm up for their game. Gemma texted Mark to ask permission and felt a thrill as he denied her. They were in for a fun day indeed.

Izzy arrived way later than usual and Mark predictably gave her shit for being late. Gemma laughed along, though she felt a nagging kernel of jealousy at the exchange. Izzy wasn’t a knockout blonde like she was, but for some reason her “girl next door” vibe started to feel threatening. Maybe it was due to how close she was to bagging Mark. She handed Izzy her coffee wishing she’d slipped even more diuretic in it.

The day got started, routine office stuff aside from meeting Helen from IT. Her bladder filled and once she got a steady nag around 9:30, she asked Mark for permission.

He denied and Gemma took a sip for good measure. Jacob walked by, reminding her of the meeting with TerraCorp and she realized her day was likely headed to a parallel of Izzy’s previous Monday. It was clever planning by Mark and she shivered as she walked into the conference room. Her bladder was growing dangerously full. But she was having fun and would’ve done anything for Mark. Unable to say nothing, she whispered “I really have to pee” once Jacob stepped out.

“Rookie mistake,” Mark said.

“Do you need to step out?” Izzy whispered.

“I’m fine. Live and learn,” Gemma said.

Her bladder was in for the fight of its life just as it had been in the Titan meeting. Not much attention was given to her as an observer and she processed little beyond corporate jargon and everyone needing to “circle back” to someone at TerraCorp named Diane. That poor woman seemed to be the first, second, and third line of communication. Gemma didn’t envy her. 11:15 arrived and Gemma lost her first dribble. She was spurting as soon as 11:19. She tried to remain professional, though it was a bit hard when Mark was hyperfocused on her and Izzy also knew she had to pee. It was a shame Izzy had put her tampered coffee in the fridge for most of the morning. The meeting would’ve been a lot more interesting with her bursting as well. She ended up with a wet spot, but managed to walk back to her desk and text Mark.

“What if he still says no?” She hadn’t considered the possibility and began to explore the potential consequences. If he did refuse, she would wet herself within minutes. She took a deep breath and fired off her request. Mark answered, with a twist.

Mark: Yes. You have one more bathroom pass for the day.

That added a new element, but all she had time to focus on was avoiding a total wetting. Gemma power walked down the hallway and threw the bathroom door open. She locked it behind her, already spurting. She threw herself onto the toilet and her body didn’t wait a second longer. She peed for what felt like ages and knew that was far from all of her bladder’s contents. Then she finally had time to respond.

Gemma: Made it 😊

Gemma: And if I only use one bathroom pass today, I get to have a 3rd next time.

Mark: Do you think you’ll only need one today?

Gemma: Almost certainly not.

In truth, she doubted she could last two hours before peeing again. Frequent bathroom trips and wettings had initially sparked her fetish and by age 30 her bladder had only graduated from “tiny” to “smaller than average”.

She headed around the corner and paused as she saw Izzy mopping the hallway to the other bathroom. “Hey, can you go around? Helen threw up and I’m cleaning.”

“Oh no! Hope she feels better,” Gemma said. Something felt off, and it didn't click until she saw the empty coffee on Izzy's desk.

"Helen was also drinking a Starbucks coffee..." Gemma couldn't confirm, but Helen's frequent bathroom trips started to make a lot more sense.

She headed back to her desk and made small talk with Mark and Kara before lunch. Mark’s Door Dash arrived and he handed her a huge cup of iced tea with a mischievous grin. They bantered over text and Mark denied her bathroom request.

They ate lunch and made small talk, which felt nice as Mark was easy to talk to and no relationship could be built solely on pee play after all. Gemma adjusted her posture constantly as the ticking time bomb of her bladder threatened to blow at any moment. Gemma asked for a break at 1:00 and was told to wait till 2:00. It wouldn’t be easy, but she’d try her hardest for Mark. The afternoon remained slow and soon the pair was texting again, with Gemma’s messages getting both flirtier and more desperate. Mark doubled down with a threat to make her wait till 2:10, and her bladder leaked in protest. She repositioned herself as Kara walked around with a work question for Mark and had to repeat it.

“Workin’ hard or hardly workin?” Kara teased.

“He’s working just as hard as usual,” Gemma butted in. Both girls high fived and Mark shook his head.

“I have been a great influence on Gemma, thank you very much,” Mark said.

“He has,” Gemma said. She shifted in her seat and sat on her foot with enough notice to draw Kara’s attention.

“You good?” Kara asked.

“Yeah. I uh… I’ve just been putting a bathroom trip off a little too long. I’ll go now before I pull an Izzy!”

It was arguably cheating, but there was no way to play off being caught that desperate. She rounded a corner at 2:01, but wasn’t sure if Mark’s earlier denial where she told her to wait till two still counted as permission. She didn’t get a response so she sent a follow up a few minutes later, lamenting the fact that Mark was either toying with her or got sucked into actual work. The third finally got an answer as more pee leaked into her slacks.

Mark: Oh shit! You can go. Assuming you haven’t gone in your pants yet.

Gemma: Only a little 😊

Her longest leak yet escaped and Gemma scrambled onto the toilet, seconds away from complete disaster. Her panties were quite damp and she knew she’d have to dab her clothes with a paper towel as damage control. Once she was out, she asked Mark to fake a phone call. Gemma’s heart pounded as they met in the parking lot.

“Sorry about that,” Mark said.

“Get stuck doing your actual job?”

“Yeah.”

“Well you answered in the nick of time,” Gemma said. She smoothed her slacks and let Mark take in her wet spot.

“How wet?”

“I leaked a few times,” Gemma admitted. “That tea went straight through me.”

Mark reached out. “Can I?”

Gemma laughed and shook her head. “We’re at work, pervert.”

They headed inside separately, but an hour later Gemma was desperate again.

3:12 Gemma: I know you said I had two passes, but I really don’t think I can last till 5

3:15 Mark: How about you try, but we have a safe word?

It was a reasonable assumption and sweet of him to make sure she was still enjoying the game. But her bladder was about to pop and an idea was forming.

3:17 Gemma: What if I “go home with a migraine”?

3:18 Mark: If you want to. I assume you don’t want to piss yourself at work in back-to-back weeks.

3:19 Gemma: As hot as that sounds, no

At 3:27, Gemma lost a decent sized leak. At 3:31 she emailed Jacob about her “migraine” and tried to act normal as Mark and Izzy wished her well. She unlocked the car and scrambled inside. She considered driving to a vacant lot, but her dam was already breaking. She turned the car on and her exhausted bladder gave out completely. She moaned as pee gushed out and pooled around her ass in the leather seat and while some streams made it all the way down her previously stained slacks. She leaned back and took it all in as her tortured bladder was finally free. Once it subsided, she texted Mark about her accident. He asked for pics and Gemma played the card she’d been sitting on all day.

She sent her address.

Mark dropped the 👀 emoji and Gemma found herself shaking from excitement. Not arousal this time, but a genuine “holy shit this is really happening!” She drove home and waited in her car for a straight shot to her apartment without people leaving, arriving, or walking dogs. She power walked inside and shut the door behind her. Pee still dripped down her legs and an angled look in the mirror confirmed that the stain around her ass was as big as it felt during the accident. She stayed in her wet clothes and browsed YellowFlow to keep herself in the mood till Mark arrived. Even though she hadn’t had anything to drink in a while, her bladder continued to ramp up its urine production. She texted Mark for fun.

4:30 Gemma: Mark, I have to pee again!

4:31 Mark: Hold it a little longer.

4:32 Gemma: I will for you.

Mark heart reacted, then at 5:02 she received her coveted “On my way” text. Once Mark said he was parking, she waited by the door. Then came the knock. WetCrystal and PuddlePirate were finally meeting to enjoy their fetish in person! But only one knew.

Mark knocked and Gemma threw the door open. “Welcome!”

Mark grinned “Hey stranger.”

Gemma spun around to give Mark the full picture. “Like what you see?”

“I do.” His eyes flashed with the hunger she briefly saw on the trail. “We have a problem,” Mark concluded as he ran a hand up and down Gemma’s soaked legs.

“What’s that?” Gemma asked.

“You were only given two bathroom passes. And it looks like you’ve peed three times.”

Gemma gasped in mock horror. “Oh no! What… what would happen if I told you I had to pee a fourth time?”

“I don’t believe you,” Mark said. “Prove it.”

“Where?”

“Bed.”

Gemma grinned. “Well that was forward.”

“You’re the one who point blank gave me your address!”

“Fair enough,” Gemma said. She took Mark’s hand and led him through the hallway. They stood before the bed and Gemma gasped as Mark pressed his hand into her soaked slacks.

“Damn, you soaked these.”

Gemma let her lip quiver. “I just couldn’t help it. And I have to go again.”

Mark shook his head. “You’ve been a bad girl. And what do bad girls get?”

“Please not a spanking!”

Mark spanked her and Gemma gasped as pee spurted out. Mark noticed and deemed she needed more spankings. Her heart pounded with each spank and after she finally convinced Mark she was a “good girl” she climbed into bed, loosing several spurts in the process. She felt her bed dampen as her wet slacks hit the sheets. Mark planted himself on top of her and unzipped her pants. He reached a hand inside and smiled hungrily at how wet her panties were. He kept his hand there and Gemma peed. It took a few short spurts as her bladder suddenly had stage fright, but soon a lake of pee was seeping out of Gemma and forming around them. Gemma could feel Mark’s erection through his now wet khakis and could only let the tension simmer for so long. She kissed him and soon the pair were making out and constantly repositioning themselves within the giant puddle. Eventually Gemma felt another small urge to pee and she let that out too.

“You can’t control yourself at all,” Mark said as he unzipped his pants. “And for that you need to be punished.”

“Then punish me,” Gemma purred.

So he did. Several times that night.

Week 2: Tuesday

Izzy’s Day

Izzy woke up shortly before her alarm. She was completely sprawled out in bed, with her closed laptop resting a few feet away. She’d been working on a post for her brand new YellowFlow account and had shut it once she grew too tired to bother getting out of bed. Her previous day had been rough, but at least she had found this strange avenue to share her new kink. She moved the laptop to its charger and pulled back the sheet of her bed. There was definitely a stain on the mattress. Maybe she could get Kara to help her flip it over sometime, though she didn’t like the idea of admitting another accident. Somehow the nighttime accident felt more embarrassing than her previous ones at work or on the trail. What if she let someone take her home and it happened on his bed?

Felix brushed against her as if sensing her mood and Izzy got up to shower, manifesting a better day for herself. She put on a peppy playlist and hummed to Dua Lipa’s “Dance The Night” as she pulled in.

7:51. Better days ahead.

Izzy headed inside, surprised to see that she beat Gemma to the office. She opened Excel to start double checking her work from yesterday, not trusting her focus while in a bad mood. Just as she wondered if Gemma was sick, she heard two voices.

“So yeah, thanks for the lift,” Gemma said.

“Anytime!” Mark said as they sat down.

“Morning, Izzy,” Gemma said. “Had a car battery issue so that’s already a great start.”

“Oh no!”

“Fortunately, I’m pretty handsy,” Mark said. Gemma snorted and he blushed. “Handy. Get your mind out of the gutter.”

They laughed it off and Izzy felt her shoulders slump, wishing she had someone to get handsy with. Stuart called within the hour and for once Izzy was more than happy to talk with him. His company had gotten audited and there was a bunch of work coming their way. There was an all hands on deck meeting within the hour and Izzy could already tell that she and Mark were about to be swamped since they were most familiar with Stuart’s assets. Izzy felt good, but then she heard the deadline.

“Two weeks for all of that? Shit,” Mark said once he, Izzy, and Gemma were back at their desks.

“Yeah, that’s a lot. But thankfully I’m at least a little familiar with the software from our meeting with Danielle,” Gemma said.

“For sure. We need all the help we can get,” Izzy said.

They theorized a little bit about how to handle it, but were largely waiting on an email from Stuart. “Need some good news?” Kara asked as she walked over.

“Of course,” Izzy said.

“If we want a night to de-stress, my sister is playing the Dripping Springs Symphony tomorrow night. My friend had to cancel last minute so I’ve got a free ticket. I don’t think they’re too expensive if all four of us want to go.”

“I’d love to go,” Izzy said.

“Me too!” Gemma said.

“I don’t mind paying for my own ticket,” Mark said. “You two ladies can play rock paper scissors for the free one or something.”

“How about a friendly little contest to decide it then,” Gemma said. “Not rock paper scissors though. Something fun.”

“Sure,” Izzy said. “I’d say we could arm wrestle, but I’ll probably get crushed since you’re a workout goddess.”

Gemma contemplated for a few seconds before a sly smile appeared. “I thought of something absurd.”

“Let’s hear it,” Izzy said.

“The most fair thing to do, would be a contest for something we’re both bad at.”

“I guess that checks out,” Izzy agreed. “What do you have in mind?”

Gemma blushed as if realizing how silly her idea was, which made Izzy all the more intrigued. “Next person to pee has to pay for their ticket.”

“Holy fuck.”

Izzy blinked and forced an awkward laugh to hide how turned on she was. “I mean sure. Though this might be a very short contest given our recent track records”

“Too true. May the best woman win,” Gemma said.

“This company is insane,” Kara said.

“I wouldn’t want it any other way,” Mark said.

Izzy got to work while angling her chair to get a better look at Gemma in the corner of her vision. Stuart’s audit was going to be quite a handful, but Izzy had helped with something similar during her first year at Goldfinch. As she read emails and opened excel files to see what she was working with, she felt her bladder which was about half full. She had peed about an hour earlier as had Gemma. The pair were often somewhat in sync with each other so her best guess was that it was anyone’s game.

After thirty minutes, she was feeling full, but far from the verge of an accident. She was certain she could last an extra half hour if not more. She looked over and found Gemma. The blonde woman was steadily tapping her foot, but not showing much desperation beyond that. Izzy turned back to her work and sighed at just how much data they had to comb through. She spent the next half hour simply hiding rows and columns to focus on the data they needed to record or tell Stuart they were still missing. Mark got up a few minutes later, but rather than going to the bathroom like Izzy first assumed, he returned with two mugs of coffee.

“A little pick me up to help you two focus on the audit.”

Izzy froze. Mark was surely just leaning into what he thought was a bit, right? Clearly Gemma did, which is why she suggested the silly competition in the first place. “Oh how thoughtful,” Gemma said. “My bladder will not at all be hating you in the next few minutes.”

“Guess I’ve got this in the bag then,” Izzy said teasingly.

Gemma spun around dramatically in her chair and turned to Mark. “Make her a second cup just for that.”

Izzy turned to him, with only a split second to decide between embarrassment and confidence. “Go ahead. I’m not scared to compete.”

“Well, I aim to please,” Mark said. He got up to pour another cup as Izzy downed her first mug, She was barely into her second mug and already cursing her terrible decision making as she felt a leak coming while Gemma annoyingly stayed focused on her work.

Izzy looked at the clock. “Five more minutes then I’m giving in.”

She lasted three before Jacob walked by. “Stuart’s on the phone again with more details. My office in five.”

“Be right there,” Gemma said sweetly. With Jacob very much in earshot, she turned to Izzy and said. “Need a quick break or are you good?”

“Holy shit that was good,” Izzy realized.

“Be right there!” she told Jacob. She got a text moments later.

Gemma: Seriously, don’t pee your pants for a silly contest

Izzy: I can hold it.

Gemma: Neither of us can. That’s why I suggested it

Izzy: Too late now lol

It took all of five minutes into the phone call for Izzy to realize how stupid she was acting. Her bladder screamed for relief reminiscent of the previous week’s Terra call, and the meeting had just started. She crossed her legs tightly beneath the table and tried her hardest to look nervous instead of desperate.

Across the table, Gemma fidgeted with her hair and bracelet. She was clearly desperate, but deep down Izzy suspected her own need was more urgent.

“… thoughts on that Izzy?”

Izzy froze, embarrassed as she had completely spaced out. “I’m sorry, which property is this for?”

“Sewell. Our top priority,” Stuart said.

“Right, sorry,” Izzy said. She shifted in her chair as she felt a dribble of pee escape. She answered the question, but in a way that was far wordier than usual. Jacob sensed something was up and Mark cast her a sympathetic look as if apologizing for the second cup of coffee. “So for the Pewter site…”

“Peterson,” Mark jumped in as Pewter was a property owned by Terra.

“Yes, sorry, Pewter. I mean Peterson, we’ve been going through the existing data gaps. Could you give a list, Mark?”

Mark had just started his answer when Stuart interrupted. “I am so sorry, we just had a package delivery that I need to sign. Be right back.”

Stuart shut off his camera and mic as Jacob muted Goldfinch’s call and turned to Izzy.

“Izzy, what’s going on?”

Izzy blushed as she lost another spurt and had no choice but to answer honestly. “This is so embarrassing, but I drank way too much coffee trying to focus and I have to pee.”

She braced herself for a lecture, but Jacob simply shrugged and said “Now’s your chance. Go.”

Izzy raced out the conference room without another word. She hated that she forfeited the free concert ticket, but all she cared about was staying dry. Two good sized leaks escaped as she booked it down the hallway and Izzy found the women’s bathroom. She pulled her pants down the second she locked the door. Her pink panties were almost completely drenched by the time she made it to the toilet and unleashed a massive torrent. She fully intended on masturbating to the experience later, but in the moment she had come far too close to disaster. She tossed her panties and washed up before returning to the conference room.

“That could’ve gone really bad,” Gemma whispered once she, Izzy, and Mark were back in their room. “I’m sorry.”

“Thankfully it didn’t. Enjoy your free ticket,” Izzy said.

“Oh, I will,” Gemma said. “But first, it’s my turn to piss.”

Izzy wondered just how desperate was, but she had no way to check unless she wanted to follow her and crack a joke about already needing to pee again. She did, but that could wait till she reached her apartment for lunch to avoid being seen peeing twice in such a short span. Izzy enjoyed a very light lunch after two cups of coffee. She pulled into the parking lot and was surprised she beat Gemma back till she remembered her car trouble. She got out and paused when she spotted movement in Mark’s car. She was about to wave to Mark as he got out when she saw it.

Mark and Gemma were making out in the backseat. Izzy froze and made horrified eye contact with Gemma who pulled away from Mark. Mark saw her next and right as Izzy decided to walk inside, he and Gemma got out.

“Hey Iz, let’s uh address this now I guess.”

Izzy wanted nothing more than to head inside and let the door slam behind her, but she inhaled and exhaled as her coworkers got closer. “Um… congrats?”

“Thanks! We uh… connected the other day,” Gemma said.

Izzy blinked. “Oh?”

“We ended up having a nice time after the run. Weren’t going to say anything till after a few more dates, but whoops!” Gemma said.

“Hope it goes well,” Izzy said. It wasn’t till she was at her desk that she accepted she was lying through her teeth.

“After the run. She fucking hit on him after I wet myself.”

The rest of the day passed in a blur as Izzy put in headphones and tried to block out the increasingly flirty banter behind her. She drove home without music on.

After some doomscrolling, Izzy typed up a message to Kara, but erased it. Instead, she stepped out on the patio and finished her YellowFlow post about her accident during the Terra call. The breeze felt nice in her hair and she kept her sliding patio door cracked open as she returned to her room, hit post, and read about a user named WetCrystal who wet herself in a half marathon. With her mind in a marginally better place, she grabbed the trashy romantasy book Kara recommended her and made her way downtown after giving Felix his dinner.

The bell jingled on the Goldwood Brew’s door as Izzy walked in. The café was fairly quiet on a weeknight and she had no trouble finding a two-person table to sit at with her tea and book. She sipped and let the predictable plot unfold until her tea ran through her system and she got up for the bathroom. She had just sat back down when a flash of red hair and a familiar voice caught her attention. Danielle Fuller.

“Fuck!”

The last thing she wanted was to bump into someone she knew, but Goldwood wasn’t that big of a town. She attempted to remain inconspicuous, but the pair eventually made eye contact.

“Hey girl!” Danielle said. She wore a white cardigan and jeans and was seated a few tables over with an Asian girl with a Goldwood Law sweatshirt.

“Hey Danielle,” Izzy said. She was content to leave things at that, but Danielle waved her over and she didn’t want to be rude. Danielle was still her client off the clock.

“Izzy, this is Emily, my best friend. Emily, this is Izzy, her company makes my job less miserable. Most of the time.”

Izzy couldn’t help laughing at the memory of the time she and Mark accidentally lost a file for Titan and had to stay up insanely late recreating it with Danielle. “I’m honored. Your company makes my job less miserable as well. Usually.”

“Ooh are you two going to spend all night talk about data entry? I’m on the edge of my seat!” Emily exclaimed.

“Don’t threaten me with a good time,” Izzy said.

“So what brings you to the Brew tonight?” Danielle asked.

“Just grabbing a drink and doing some reading. Long day.”

“I feel that. Hope it’s not too much on my end,” Danielle said.

“Oh no. We have another client with a big audit.” As Izzy took a sip she realized she felt comfortable and added, “Also guy problems, which I might be using as a cover up for Izzy problems.”

Emily perked up. “I’ve known you for five minutes and I’m ready for all the details. Let’s drink some literal tea while you spill the figurative tea.”

“You don’t have to,” Danielle assured her.

“Screw it. It’s been a rough day,” Izzy said.

They bought a second round of drinks and Izzy talked through her struggles, while keeping Mark and Gemma anonymous. Both Danielle and Emily listened, the former being the good cop and latter being the bad one.

“So yeah. At the end of the day I can’t really blame him. I’ve known him for three years after all,” Izzy concluded.

There was as the barista behind her dropped a mug and apologized.

“Jesus, Audrey! You scared us!” Emily laughed as she corralled pieces of the broken mug with her foot.

“Not my proudest moment,” Audrey said as she laughed it off.

Danielle turned to Izzy with a mischievous glint in her eye. “So that call we have tomorrow at 10? Let’s blow it off another day,” Danielle said. “I know it’s a work night, but who says it has to end already?”

“Fuck it. I’m in,” Izzy said.

Emily high fived her. “Hell yeah!”

Izzy joined Danielle and Emily at Maxie’s, a bar just a block away from the Brew. It was busier than Izzy expected for a Tuesday night, with music blaring and people drinking, throwing darts, and shooting pool. They split a pitcher and Izzy got absolutely smoked by Danielle in a game of darts. As she drank and played, a familiar sensation crept up as beer joined the tea inside in bladder. She scanned the back wall looking for a bathroom and Emily noticed her eyes wandering.

“Looking for something?”

“Just the bathroom for when I’ll need it,” Izzy said. It was somewhere between a lie and the truth. She was getting desperate, but not all the way there.

“Give it about five minutes. Dani’s bladder is the size of a grape,” Emily said.

Danielle flipped her the double birds before grinning. “She’s absolutely right of course. In fact…” She motioned and Izzy leaned in. “I nearly pissed myself in that meeting we had with you guys last week.”

“Oh no! That went on for ages!” Izzy laughed.

“Yeah. I should’ve just excused myself but I didn’t want to interrupt,” Danielle admitted.

“Girl. Just go pee next time,” Izzy said.

“And just for the record, I’ve seen Emily piss herself just as often as me. Well, almost as often,” Danielle added.

“Holy shit,” Izzy realized. “I need to join this friend group.”

“Wait really?”

“Yep. Two years of Christmas shopping trips. A concert. A basketball game. We have issues,” Emily said.

“Like medical issues?” Izzy asked.

“Coffee, alcohol, and poor judgment issues,” Danielle said. “And on that note, tequila shots?”

“Let’s do it. And while we wait, I’ve got an embarrassing story of my own,” Izzy said.

As they waited in line, Izzy confessed her accident at work and had both Danielle and Emily chanting “One of us!” by the end. Izzy took her shot, sucked on a lime, and then the three of them hit the karaoke line. Just as they were about to go onstage, Izzy felt something warm.

“You good?” Danielle asked as Izzy gasped too loudly.

“I have to pee so fucking bad,” Izzy admitted.

“Pissing yourself onstage would be legendary,” Emily said.

“Don’t encourage her!” Danielle chided.

“Does someone have to go too?” Emily teased.

“I mean yes, but that’s not the point!” Danielle said.

“I’ll be fine,” Izzy said. They went up for a chaotic rendition of Firework, and Izzy lost another leak by the first chorus, and then another one soon later. It wasn’t long before she could feel a wet patch form on her pants. She lost another spurt, but miraculously she held on till the song’s end. The second they got off the stage, all three ran for the bathroom. Izzy continued to lose spurts as she ran, before rounding the corner and sighing.

The line was out the bathroom door. Izzy turned to Danielle, whose jeans had a wet spot as well. Before either could get a word in, they lost control almost simultaneously. Izzy felt the now familiar warmth as her bladder could take no more and completely crumpled. She watched the rivulets race down her leg and spill to the floor, but Danielle’s presence certainly made this accident less embarrassing.

“My puddle’s bigger than yours,” Danielle bragged.

Izzy laughed, before relaxing her sphincter again and loosing another small spurt. “That’s at least closer.”

“I can’t take you anywhere,” Emily teased Danielle as she returned with a bartender and a wet floor sign. “Or you either apparently,” she told Izzy.

“So do you want to wait in that giant line?” Danielle asked.

“Fuck no,” Emily laughed. Her jeans looked suspiciously a touch darker around the crotch, and the moment they were outside, she sprinted for an alleyway as Danielle laughed. Izzy watched from the corner of her eye as Emily ripped her pants and panties down before being full force into the dark street.

“And that’s a normal night for me and Emily. You didn’t even get to meet the others yet,” Danielle laughed.

“I appreciate it,” Izzy said. “Somehow my day didn’t get worse when I pissed myself.”

“Strangely relatable,” Emily said. “See you around!”

Izzy waved goodbye before putting on her 2010s pop playlist after listening to a lot of it as people sang karaoke. She arrived home just as “Some Nights” by Fun hit its last chorus. She stayed in the car to finish it before getting out. “Hey Felix!”

There was oddly enough no sign of him. Izzy looked in closets and under her bed before her heart stopped. She had left her patio door cracked open!

She stared at Danielle’s contact info but didn’t want to bother her twice in the same night. Having already made a slew of bad decisions, she added another to the tally and called Mark.

It went to voicemail.

Izzy sat on her toilet in her wet clothes and sobbed. Then she got a call a few minutes later.

“Hey Iz, what is it?” Mark asked.

Mark’s Day

Mark couldn’t believe how fucking lucky he was as he awoke next to Gemma. The previous day was a blur from his game with Gemma, to the sex, to the peeing, to more sex…

“9 to 5” suddenly started blaring. “Holy fuck!” Mark shouted as Gemma started laughing.

“Welp, we’ve gotta make a living,” Gemma said. “Shower time!”

After giving each other a golden shower followed by a regular shower, they got dressed as Gemma made them protein shakes. “Do we leave separately?” Mark asked.

“I’m having car trouble, so I get to be your passenger princess,” Gemma declared.

“Fair enough,” Mark said. “Just don’t expect to get there on time.”

“I don’t,” Gemma laughed.

They got to the car and Mark invited Gemma to pick the music. She went with 2010s pop, music that wasn’t Mark’s favorite growing up but did have nostalgia attached. They pulled into to work to the tune of “Some Nights” by Fun and Mark took a second to take in that this could be his reality almost every day.

8:05 Better days ahead.

They arrived at work and Gemma told Izzy and Kara about her “car trouble”. What seemed to be a normal Tuesday went awry almost immediately as Jacob informed the team of an audit for Rinaldi Enterprises. It was a lot, but the news wasn’t all bad.

“If we want a night to de-stress, my sister is playing the Dripping Springs Symphony tomorrow night. My friend had to cancel last minute so I’ve got a free ticket. I don’t think they’re too expensive if all four of us want to go,” Kara said.

Mark, Izzy, and Gemma were on board, and Mark didn’t mind paying for his own ticket. He somewhat jokingly suggested a contest between Izzy and Gemma and his heart nearly stopped as Gemma ran with it.

“The most fair thing to do, would be a contest for something we’re both bad at.”

“I guess that checks out,” Izzy agreed. “What do you have in mind?”

Gemma blushed, quite a cute sight for someone usually so confident. “Next person to pee has to pay for their ticket.”

“Holy fuck.”

One of the oldest YellowFlow tropes was the coveted holding contest and Gemma had somehow initiated one with a straight face.

“I mean sure. Though this might be a very short contest given our recent track records,” Izzy said with a laugh.

“Too true. May the best woman win,” Gemma said.

“This company is insane,” Kara said.

“I wouldn’t want it any other way,” Mark said. He traded a knowing look with Gemma before an evil idea crossed his mind soon after. He got up and handed both women a fresh cup of coffee. They had a lot of work ahead of them and needed to focus after all.

Soon trash talk started and Gemma cornered Izzy into drinking a second cup. Mark and Gemma traded knowing glances as he got up to make Izzy a second cup. The holding contest was rudely interrupted as Jacob walked by after hearing more from Stuart. They had to jump on a call, but neither woman backed down. Mark headed to Jacob’s office horny, but with a touch of secondhand embarrassment. He really hoped he didn’t watch Izzy dig her own grave.

The call with Stuart was rough. He talked in circles like usual and Izzy quickly became a stuttering mess as she fought back two cups of coffee. Mark grew hard as he imagined her leaking like she had in the previous week’s Terra call, but he had no way to discretely check. Gemma had rigid posture and tapped her foot, but was clearly holding up better. Stuart excused himself to pick up a package and Jacob turned to Izzy.

“Izzy, what’s going on?”

Izzy blushed as she no choice but to answer honestly. “This is so embarrassing, but I drank way too much coffee trying to focus and I have to pee.”

Mark expected a lecture, but Jacob simply shrugged and said “Now’s your chance. Go.” Izzy raced out the conference room without another word. She returned a few minutes later looking relieved and the call finished without incident.

“That could’ve gone really bad,” Gemma whispered once they were back in their room. “I’m sorry.”

“Thankfully it didn’t. Enjoy your free ticket,” Izzy said.

“Oh, I will,” Gemma said. “But first, it’s my turn to piss.”

She took off around the corner and Mark wondered just how dry Gemma was. Soon it was lunch as he and Gemma headed to a diner. “How the fuck did that work?” Mark asked the second they were inside his car.

“I have no idea,” Gemma laughed. “Izzy just stumbled headfirst into my trap.”

“Gemma Wade. The hunter,” Mark said with a grin.

They ate a somewhat quick lunch and headed back towards Goldfinch. As Mark sat at a red light, he spotted an abandoned gas station up ahead. He pulled in.

“Oh?” Gemma asked.

Mark leaned over with a grin. “I think it’s time for a little inspection. Let’s see how dry you are.”

Gemma laughed. “Don’t threaten me with a good time.”

He unzipped her pants and found her panties were predictably damp. “Looks like someone had a close call.”

“I really wanted that free ticket. What can I say?”

“Genuine leak or did you do that on purpose?”

“Woman’s secret,” Gemma said with a wink.

A handjob and makeout session later, they were back on the road. Mark parked the car, but Gemma protested as he was about to turn it off. “Kiss me again.”

Mark kissed her and just as it was starting to lead to more, Gemma pulled away. “Shit!”

He turned his head and his stomach dropped. Izzy awkwardly walked by and had definitely seen them. He stood by both what Audrey told him and his decision to pursue Gemma. But he felt bad all the same. They got out and met Izzy.

“Hey Iz, let’s uh address this now I guess.”

“Um… congrats?” Izzy managed.

“Thanks! We uh… connected the other day,” Gemma said.

Izzy blinked. “Oh?”

“We ended up having a nice time after the run. Weren’t going to say anything till after a few more dates, but whoops!” Gemma said.

“Hope it goes well,” Izzy said.

It was an almost silent afternoon. Neither he nor Gemma felt in the mood till they were leaving and Gemma admitted she’d been desperate to pee since three. Mark considered going by the Brew just to torture her, but decided on just the gas station since he needed to fill up before driving to Dripping Springs the next day. He walked out and handed Gemma an Arizona Iced Tea.

The evening was complete euphoria once again as they tried more pee play and Gemma decided she was officially on board with the kink. After a few rounds in a pee soaked bed, they decided to shower before doing laundry. The night slowed down a bit as Gemma made some of her super healthy foods for dinner that were admittedly better than Mark thought. They put on some trashy reality TV before getting bored and trying a few new positions now that they couldn’t ruin newly washed sheets. The pair were spooning when Mark’s phone went off on the nightstand. He reached over and did a double take.

“Oh shit. Felix!”

“Who’s Felix?”

“Izzy's cat. He’s missing.”

“Aww, poor thing,” Gemma said. “Maybe we can make some flyers if she can’t find him tonight.”

“Hopefully it won’t come to that,” Mark said as he put on his shoes.

“The fuck are you doing?” Gemma asked.

“I’m going to find a cat. You coming or not?”

“It’s 10:30 on a Tuesday!” Gemma protested. “You just said one more round before bed.”

“Well that can wait till I’m home. Or tomorrow.” Gemma remained silent as Mark headed to the door. “What is it?”

“It just… it feels like you’re choosing Izzy over me right now,” Gemma confessed.

Mark paused, wondering if he was making a mistake. Was Gemma testing him? Hell, should he test her? He walked back over and kissed her. “I chose you all day today and all day yesterday. If I’m choosing anyone, it’s this goddamn cat.”

“So you’re going regardless?” Gemma asked.

“Yeah. Want to come?”

“No, that’s fine. I shouldn’t have said anything. Go be a good friend.”

They kissed and he headed out the door. Mark felt a little shitty before shaking it off. From what he’d gathered, Gemma had dealt with a lot of insecurities growing up. Perhaps jealousy was some form of it that stuck with her as an adult. He texted Izzy and found her looking around outside with a flashlight.

“Thanks for coming!” Izzy said. There was a hint of tequila on her breath, which she explained. Apparently she and “the girls” had gone out. “The girls” didn’t include Kara when Mark asked, but they heard a meow before he could ask more. They raced to the noise and before long they were on the their hands and knees. Finally, they found him in a flower bed. Mark lured him out with some catnip and Izzy scooped him up. The day was saved!

“Thanks so much and sorry for dragging you into this so late. Good news is that Dani said she had to cancel our meeting tomorrow morning.”

“You’re on a nickname basis with Danielle?”

“I don’t know why I called her that. It’s been a weird night,” Izzy said.

Mark saluted her. “See you tomorrow, Iz.”

He started walking away when Izzy blurted out. “I meant what I said after lunch by the way. I’m happy for you and Gemma.”

“Thanks Iz.” Mark headed to his car and looked back. Izzy turned to act like she wasn’t watching him leave.

Gemma’s Day

“Holy fuck!” Mark shouted as “9 to 5” started blaring.

Gemma burst out laughing as she took in how lucky she was. No, skillful. Getting with Mark this soon should’ve been way harder.

“Welp, we’ve gotta make a living,” Gemma said. “Shower time!”

After giving each other a golden shower followed by a regular shower, they got dressed as Gemma made them protein shakes. Before long they were on the road, running a bit late given their cover up about Gemma having car trouble. She went with 2010s pop, music for some fun nostalgia and pulled into to work to the tune of “Some Nights” by Fun. It was crazy to think that this could soon become a reality.

8:05 Better days ahead.

Work was actually quite crazy for a change as Stuart’s company got audited. She and Mark were too busy to experiment with any other bladder control games, but that changed when a golden opportunity fell in her lap. Kara had a free ticket to the Dripping Springs Symphony and Izzy wasn’t sure what kind of friendly contest they should wage after Mark dropped out.

“The most fair thing to do, would be a contest for something we’re both bad at,” Gemma said.

“I guess that checks out,” Izzy agreed. “What do you have in mind?”

Gemma blushed. Her idea was so insane that it had to be presented as such. “Next person to pee has to pay for their ticket.” She held her breath and waited for Izzy to tell her it was a good joke.

“I mean sure. Though this might be a very short contest given our recent track records,” Izzy said with a laugh.

“Too true. May the best woman win,” Gemma said.

“This company is insane,” Kara said.

“I wouldn’t want it any other way,” Mark said.

The second Izzy turned around, Gemma stared at Mark in stunned silence. Mark later got coffee for each contestant. “Oh how thoughtful,” Gemma said. “My bladder will not at all be hating you in the next few minutes.”

“Guess I’ve got this in the bag then,” Izzy said teasingly.

“Oh sweet summer child.” Little did Izzy know the contest was a one v. two. Gemma spun around dramatically in her chair and turned to Mark. “Make her a second cup just for that.”

Izzy turned to him. “Go ahead. I’m not scared to compete.”

“Well, I aim to please,” Mark said.

Gemma couldn’t believe it as Izzy drank both mugs. She was acting uncharacteristically stupid, and almost immediately had to face the consequences as Jacob called them in for another phone call. Gemma texted Izzy to offer an out, while hoping she'd be too stubborn to take it. That was exactly what happened. While Gemma’s own bladder was getting full, Izzy was clearly beside herself and stumbling over her words in the meeting. As much as Gemma was looking forward to the inevitable accident, the “work” part of the meeting was hard to watch.

“If you’ll excuse me, a package just arrived,” Stuart said.

“Fuck!”

Gemma watched in defeat as Jacob confronted Izzy and she took off racing to the bathroom. She prayed for a locked door or accident while running, but Izzy returned looking refreshed a few minutes later. At least she didn’t have to pay for the concert.

As the second half of the call dragged on, Gemma felt the pressure as her bladder went from filling to demanding relief at all costs. It didn’t occur till Jacob and Stuart were clearly winding the meeting down, but she did leak. For a few seconds, she was taken back to the afternoon of the Titan visit where her plan to lead Mark on with a near miss turned to a full-on accident. Was she in store for something similar?

The meeting ended and she, Mark, and Izzy returned to their side of the office. “That could’ve gone really bad. I’m sorry,” Gemma whispered as if she hadn’t been praying for it.

“Thankfully it didn’t. Enjoy your free ticket,” Izzy said.

“Oh, I will,” Gemma said. “But first, it’s my turn to piss.” She turned down the hall and pulled on the door.

“I’ll be out in a minute. Sorry!” Kara said.

Gemma grimaced as another leak escaped. Was history about to repeat itself? She powerwalked through the hallway and waved awkwardly to Marisol who left the other women’s room in the nick of time. Gemma pulled down her pants and admittedly quite wet panties with seconds to spare.

“How the fuck did that work?” Mark asked later as they headed to lunch.

“I have no idea,” Gemma laughed. “Izzy just stumbled headfirst into my trap.”

“Gemma Wade. The hunter,” Mark said with a grin.

Her earlier laments about the lack of time for getting naughty with Mark were answered on the way back as Mark pulled into an abandoned gas station and decided she was due for an “inspection”. One thing led to another and soon they were back at Goldfinch. They were about to get out when Gemma spotted Izzy walking by.

“Kiss me again,” Gemma said.

Mark kissed her and before it could lead to more, Gemma pulled away as she made eye contact with Izzy by complete coincidence. “Shit!”

Mark awkwardly got out of the car while Izzy remained frozen in place. It was a car crash Gemma couldn’t look away from. “PuddlePirate, you are officially mine.”

“Hey Iz, let’s uh address this now I guess.”

“Um… congrats?” Izzy managed.

“Thanks! We uh… connected the other day,” Gemma said.

Izzy blinked. “Oh?”

“We ended up having a nice time after the run. Weren’t going to say anything till after a few more dates, but whoops!” Gemma said.

“Hope it goes well,” Izzy said.

Gemma had no clue if Izzy had any feelings towards Mark beyond being work friends, but damn it felt good to stake her claim.

The afternoon at work was a complete dud as Mark and Izzy were awkward, but at least Mark bought her a giant iced tea on the way home. Soon after drinking it, Gemma pissed the bed, got railed in the bed, pissed in the shower, got railed in the shower, then they were back repeating things in bed. Her khaki slacks reeked of piss as did her panties. They threw everything in the laundry with the sheets and showered, where Gemma let out a final torrent that the iced tea had packed into her exhausted bladder.

They got a slice of normal life together as she made dinner and they watched bad reality TV before growing bored and having some “lame non peeing sex” in the fresh sheets. She started to tell herself she was the luckiest woman alive, but that wasn’t true. She had manifested this. She was a fucking goddess.

Mark’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. He reached over and grabbed it. “Oh shit. Felix!”

“Who’s Felix?” Gemma asked.

“Izzy's cat. He’s missing.”

“Aww, poor thing,” Gemma said. “Maybe we can make some flyers if she can’t find him tonight.”

“Hopefully it won’t come to that,” Mark said.

Gemma watched as he put on his shoes. “The fuck are you doing?”

“I’m going to find a cat. You coming or not?”

“It’s 10:30 on a Tuesday!” Gemma protested. “You just said one more round before bed.”

“Well that can wait till I’m home. Or tomorrow.”

“Wait till tomorrow." It had been so long since she felt any sort of rejection, but the thought of Mark dropping everything to help Izzy felt like a knife through her chest. She went silent.

“What is it?" Mark asked.

“It just… it feels like you’re choosing Izzy over me right now,” Gemma said. She did feel that way, but she had to act like it was a rational conclusion.

Mark walked back over and kissed her. “I chose you all day today and all day yesterday. If I’m choosing anyone, it’s this goddamn cat.”

“So you’re going regardless?” Gemma asked, masking most of her defeat.

“Yeah. Want to come?”

“No, that’s fine. I shouldn’t have said anything. Go be a good friend.” It was the responsible thing to do, even if she felt herself burning with jealousy. She was so close, but one wrong move could still ruin everything. She started to log into YellowFlow, but closed out before she typed her password and climbed into bed.

The latest pee content could wait till another day. But finding new ways to humiliate Izzy? That was a lot more fun.
