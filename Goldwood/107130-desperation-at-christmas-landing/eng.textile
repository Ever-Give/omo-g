Desperation at Christmas Landing

Hey Omo Org! A couple years ago, I wrote a Halloween story

&&

And I thought it'd be fun if Audrey from the Halloween festival also had a Christmas job. While some characters overlap, it'll still make sense if you haven't read the other one. Enjoy!

The holiday season was in full swing in the town of Goldwood. Snow fell outside most days as shops and small businesses decorated. Students at Goldwood College prepared for finals and the residents put up lights and Christmas trees. Among the festivities a handful of seasonal businesses popped up, and just like every year, the flagship location was Christmas Landing. Audrey had been lucky to land a job there after a good recommendation letter from her boss at Dripping Springs’ Halloween festival and it gave her a nice job with occasional downtime to study.

Christmas Landing had opened on November 1 like it did every year, but Audrey was ready for one of the biggest days of the year- the first Saturday after Thanksgiving. Not only would the store be packed, but her boss had also received a letter from the Goldwood Ledger asking if they could visit for a piece. Audrey had never been in the news before but thought it could be fun to give a quote or two. She styled her black hair then put on her capris, ugly sweater, and candy cane patterned socks before heading out the door.

She was a bit ahead of schedule and swung by Starbucks for a nice pick me up. Fresh off a payday, she grabbed peppermint mochas for everyone that would be working. Christmas music played on the radio and she headed to work ready for a great day.

The first sign that something was off came when she arrived in the parking lot. A van was there and her manager argued with two plumbers. She was a woman around 30 named Megan with blonde hair in a bun.

“What do you mean it will take all day to fix? This is one of our busiest days of the year!” Megan said.

“Well I’m sorry ma’am, the pipes froze and burst and there’s not much that can be done about that. It’s not an easy fix,” the plumber said.

“Is everything alright?” Audrey said as she walked up.

“No this is a disaster!” Megan exclaimed. “Our pipes burst and it’s going to take all day to fix. That would require us to block off part of the store on the day the Goldwood Ledger is here!”

“It’ll be fine,” Audrey said trying to calm her down. “Maybe they can work and if the paper asks you can spin it into a warning about checking pipes for freezing.”

Megan took a deep breath. “You’re probably right.”

“So are we good to get to work?” the plumber asked.

“Yes, go ahead,” Megan said.

Laughing off the rough morning, they headed inside. A few minutes later, the third coworker for that day, Erica arrived. She was one of the nicest people Audrey knew, a cute African American girl with short hair and glasses. Both Erica and Megan thanked Audrey for the drinks.

“Hopefully that coffee won’t cause any problems with the plumbing situation going on,” Audrey joked.

“Oh we’ll be fine,” Megan assured her. “That company just exaggerates everything and is a pain to work with. That said, they were the only ones with availability this morning so I can’t complain too much.”

“That’s good to know,” Audrey said. The shop only had a single stalled bathroom. Usually she used it once during her morning shift and was fine for the whole afternoon if she went at lunch, but was pretty confident she could last till noon in a pinch.

Erica looked at her phone. “Twenty minutes till customers get here, and the paper should be here any minute. What all do we need to do?”

“You and I can make sure all the shelves are arranged nicely and that the ornaments on display look good,” Megan said. “Audrey, can you check the scarves, gloves, and hats? Those always get mixed up by the customers.”

“Sure thing,” Audrey said. She fixed her black hair and headed to the clothing section of the store. As she walked, she saw Megan shoot a glance in the direction of the out of order bathroom. Hopefully she was just checking on the plumbers rather than already in need of the bathroom.

Clara’s morning was in every sense of the word, a disaster. Her day started by waking up to a soaked diaper. That was a pretty regular occurrence for the 26-year-old reporter no matter how embarrassed she was to admit it. Her bladder was tiny and she’d finally caved to her doctor’s suggestion to wear protection. She headed to her bathroom and realized that the pack of diapers she’d been keeping in a drawer was empty. She pulled open other drawers to find a new pack, but those were empty. Once Clara rummaged through cleaning supplies under the sink with no luck either, she began to worry. She meant to buy some the night before, but it was raining and she was too sleepy by the time it stopped. She could have sworn she had at least one left though! On a normal day she wouldn’t have minded, but it was the day of the Christmas Landing story and the last thing she needed was more stress.

Her worries faded for a bit as she showered, ate breakfast, and changed into the cute red blouse she’d picked out for the visit to Christmas landing. She hesitated a bit since her outfit was originally intended to have white pants, but still followed through with it. She lacked her usual safety net, but most of her accidents had come overnight in recent months. She grabbed a hat and coat and headed out the door.

Then her car didn’t start. The wavy-haired brunette sighed and turned the key in the ignition again. The car remained dead with an engine service light on the dashboard. “First I’m out of diapers and now this!” She’d needed a new car for a while now, but was determined to ride her 2001 Corolla into the ground before making a monster purchase. Perhaps that time was coming sooner rather than later. She toyed with the pom-pom on her hat and texted the photographer she was working with.

“Hey River, I’m running late. Car won’t start. Going to get an Uber.”

Her phone buzzed a few seconds later. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll come pick you up!”

Clara sighed in relief. This was her first time working with this photographer and she truly was a sweetheart. She texted River her address and went back inside to wait. She felt a small twinge in her bladder after a few minutes of waiting and debated going to pee again. She walked to her bathroom when her phone buzzed again saying River was outside. Clara shrugged and walked back outside.

River rolled down the window of her truck and waved. Clara waved back and headed to the passenger side.

“Crazy morning, huh?” River said. The natural blonde had streaks of red and green in her hair this time of year and Clara admired her boldness.

“Yep. That piece of junk knew something important was today and just had to break down,” Clara laughed.

“Happens to the best of us,” River said. “Care for a pick me up on the way there?”

“I’d love something!” Clara said. Her bladder was starting to fill up, but she could just use the bathroom at Christmas Landing before they got started with the story. She hadn’t gotten any of the seasonal drinks that year and her gingerbread latte was so good that she finished nearly half of it by the time they arrived. She climbed down from River’s truck and headed inside with her notebook and laptop.

Clara was greeted with a giant Christmas tree covered in twinkling lights and dozens of novelty ornaments that the shop sold. River snapped a photo of the tree along with a nearby display of Santa and Mrs. Claus making cookies.

“Good morning! You must be the reporter and photographer. I’m Megan Clemmons, the owner of Christmas Landing,” said a woman walking up to them.

“Nice to meet you. Clara Daniels of the Goldwood Ledger.”

“And I’m River Evans her photographer.”

It looked like the staff was still setting up the store, so Clara took the opportunity to head to the back and find a bathroom. That gingerbread latte was really making its presence known! She walked down one of several aisles of stockings, past a stack of boxes containing light reindeer yard decorations and finally found a door in the back corner.

Clara walked up to it and froze. An “Out of Order” sign was taped to the door. She started to walk back when she saw one of the employees. “Hey, any idea when it’s getting fixed?”

The employee, a black haired woman whose nametag ready “Audrey” smiled apologetically. “Our pipes burst overnight so we’re not sure. Megan’s calling to see if we can get a porta potty in parking lot. It’s not great, but we’ll power through.”

Clara’s stomach dropped, but she tried to mask her worry. “That we will!”

She headed back towards the entrance and nearly collided with Megan.

“So sorry!” Megan said before finding Audrey. Clara told her not to worry but whirled around moments later.

“Ten?” Audrey gasped.

“Yep. They don’t open till nine and then they have to load everything and drive over,” Megan said.

“Not ideal, but we can roll with the punches,” Audrey said. “Those coffees might’ve been a mistake.”

Clara nervously walked back over. “Did I hear that right? No porta potties till ten?”

“Unfortunately,” Megan said.

Clara swallowed hard and then found River to examine her first round of photos. It was 7:45, and a line was queuing outside as customers waited for 8:00. It was the biggest story of the year and there wasn’t going to be a toilet available till ten! Her tiny bladder was in for the fight of its life.

Part 2!

Danielle’s teeth chattered as she waited in line outside Christmas Landing. Even with her coat, gloves, scarf, and hot chocolate, she was absolutely freezing. Her best friend Emily stood beside her with a smirk, silently saying “I told you so,” after Danielle opted not to wear a hat. Perhaps that was a mistake, but she had wanted her red hair to look nice in case she was featured in any photos taken by River.

“It’s so warm and toasty under this,” Emily said tapping her wool hat.

“Emily, I swear I'm about to rip that hat off and wear it myself.”

Emily took a sip of hot chocolate. “Sounds like someone’s jealous.”

Danielle pretended to ignore her while sipping hot chocolate and waiting in line. There were just ten minutes left, but the longer they stood Danielle found herself jealous of Emily in a different aspect. Her hot chocolate was working through her system quite fast, and as embarrassing as it was to admit, Emily- a petite Asian woman half a foot shorter her, had a much stronger bladder. At least she only had to wait ten more minutes. Emily found River through the shop’s window and took a picture before opening their group chat.

Emily: [Picture of River]

Danielle: Hey I know her!

River: [picture of Emily and Danielle captioned "My stalkers! 😍"]

The doors opened a few minutes later and Danielle headed inside. Christmas had always been her favorite holiday as a kid and touring an entire Christmas store came close to capturing that childlike wonder. Most customers headed straight for the Christmas tree in the front for photos, so she and Emily examined a few ornament displays before finding River.

Their photographer friend was talking with the reporter. After some brief introductions, Danielle gave Clara a few quotes on how she visited Christmas Landing her first year in college and returning was a yearly tradition even after graduating. Emily described her favorite decorations and the group stood around talking for a bit until two employees started setting up a table in the corner.

“Is that what I think it is?” Danielle asked as she smelled apple and cinnamon.

“Yep! Fresh cider!” said an employee named Audrey carrying a steaming pot.

“That sounds amazing,” Emily said. She chugged the remainder of her hot chocolate and Danielle followed suit. It wasn’t until she had half of her cup that she remembered she needed to pee.

“Hey, where’s the bathroom?” Danielle asked Audrey as she finished her cup and accepted a second one.

Audrey grimaced. “Well about that… our pipes burst so we’re waiting on porta potties right now.”

“Oh no!”

“Yep. Just our luck. The staff might regret drinking our morning coffees, but we’ll manage,” Audrey said.

Danielle wished her the best of luck while noticing that Audrey’s legs were subtly crossed. Her heart started to race at the thought of an entire store's worth of people unable to pee. It wasn’t a fetish she ever expected to have, but a few too many accidents as an adult had awakened just that. Clara was nervously tapping her foot and River was a bit squirmy too. Like Danielle, River’s bladder was also on the smaller side and they’d seen each other desperate or soaked multiple times. Emily insisted they wouldn’t be there long enough to need a porta potty and drank her third free sample of apple cider. “Must be nice,” Danielle thought as she reluctantly drank her second cup before it got cold and followed Emily to look around.

Clara released a nervous breath as River’s friends walked away. They were nice, but hiding her desperation had taken a considerable amount of effort. She smiled for a picture to be featured in the article, and was pleasantly surprised by the result. No one reading would have the slightest clue that the cheery journalist was in dire need of a bathroom.

“Want some cider?” River asked approaching her with two cups.

Clara blushed. “I really shouldn’t…”

“Oh come on! Let’s get in the Christmas spirit,” River said.

Clara reluctantly accepted to avoid being rude, and much to her bladder’s torture, the cider was delicious. “That is good.”

River smiled while taking a picture of Clara sipping cider followed by one of Audrey passing some out to customers. Clara tapped her foot while making a note to highlight the apple cider in the article. “If I buy some for an evening comfort drink, I’m definitely wearing a diaper to bed those nights.” She and River headed to the Christmas lights were she interviewed a young couple picking out strands for their first house.

“I could spend all day here,” River said as they walked away. “But first, I’m going to run to the bathroom before Santa gets here.”

“Actually, their pipes burst so it’s out of service,” Clara said.

“Oh. I uh… guess I’ll wait. Might’ve drunk too much coffee and cider,” River said.

“Right there with you,” Clara admitted. “Audrey said porta potties should show up around ten.”

River checked her phone. “8:45. Won’t be fun, but I’ll manage.”

Realization that it was only 8:45 seemed to make the minutes tick by agonizingly slow. If Clara’s bladder was asking for release earlier, it was screaming for it now. An elderly couple dressed as Santa and Mrs. Claus arrived at 8:55 and Clara made sure to interview them before she was reduced to an anxious pants-peeing mess. When Santa ended the conversation asking her what she wanted for Christmas, she froze because the only thing on her mind was “a diaper”.

River jumped in with “How about a new car?”

“Oh definitely that. It wouldn’t start today,” Clara said. River truly was a godsend.

Then at 9:15 it happened. Clara and River were goofing off and looking at tacky ornaments when a jet of pee burst from Clara’s bladder.

“Clara? You look like you’ve seen a ghost!”

Clara’s heart pounded. She was a grown ass woman who had to look another grown ass woman in eye and tell her she was about to piss her pants. That was humiliating no matter how nice River was. “I…”

Another spurt escaped and trickled down her white pants. “I’m having a bathroom emergency…” she choked out.

River gasped. “Come with me.” She grabbed Clara by the arm as the pair powerwalked through the store in search of an employee. Clara lost another spurt forming the first true wet patch on her white pants. Finally they found Audrey who River flagged down.

“Bathroom emergency. Is there anywhere else we could go?” River asked.

“Oh you poor thing! I think we’ve got a bucket in a supply closet,” Audrey said. The three of them headed to the back past customers, spare boxes, and Megan who was once again arguing with the plumbers. At the end of the hall was a door. “Try there!”

Clara raced to the closet. A five second leak escaped as she realized it was locked and Audrey fumbled with her keys. She found the right one and yanked the door open.

It was too late. By the time River pulled the mop cart out of the way, Clara lost all control of her bladder. A torrent of hot pee spilled out before she could even unbutton her pants. Clara felt beyond ashamed and soon her flood of pee was joined by a flood of tears. River gingerly helped pull her pants down and Clara sat in the bucket to finish her accident, not bothering to take her panties off.

“Everything’s ruined!” Clara sobbed.

“Clara, it’s okay,” River said patting her back.

“This was my biggest story of the year! I just…”

“Don’t worry about it. Accidents happen,” River said.

Clara sighed. “Sweet of you to say, but you’re not the one who pissed herself at 26. And the truth is… I still have accidents regularly. I wear diapers to bed or big events but today I ran out. I’m pathetic.” She had no idea why she was confessing her most vulnerable secret to woman she’d met three hours ago, but here she was.

Then she heard more peeing. Clara looked down expecting to find herself losing control again, but she looked up to see a dark stain snaking down River’s red and green leggings. Clara gasped before scrambling out of the bucket and sliding it under River. It caught a good bit and even more spilled out when River pulled down the top of her leggings to inspect the damage to her candy cane patterned panties.

“River, did you just?”

“A solidarity pee. Plus I really wasn’t kidding when I said I drank too much coffee and cider.” Clara hugged her before the pair returned to reality. They were wearing soaked pants in the back corner of a packed store.

“So now what?” Clara laughed.

Audrey poked her head around the corner. “I’ll get this cleaned up. I um… overheard what happened. Would you like me to have my sister bring fresh clothes? She even has some… similar issues to Clara if she’d like protection.”

“Yes please!” Clara and River said.

“On it. Go ahead and wait in the corner of the staff room in the meantime.”

Clara thanked her and headed to the back room with River. The pair soon burst out laughing at the absurdity of their situation.

Mopping up pee wasn’t on Audrey’s bingo card for the big day, but here she was. She fired a text off to Katie.

Audrey: Hey loser are you awake?

Katie: Yeah. Why?

Audrey: So… our bathroom’s out of service and two women just pissed themselves. Could you bring some fresh clothes. I think one would like a diaper too.

Katie: Oh no! At breakfast, but I’ll swing by the house and get some clothes as soon as I’m done.

Audrey sighed in relief as she put her phone in her pocket. She walked out the back door and poured the pee from the bucket into the grass and set it aside as she started to mop. She squirmed a bit, with her own urge to pee noticeable but not dangerous. It was still thirty minutes till ten, and the way the morning had gone, she just knew those would be running late too.

Things changed as soon as she first squeezed the mop. The sound of falling water triggered an incredibly aggressive “lock and key” response. She lost a spurt and only regained control for a few seconds before she lost several more leaks. Audrey raced for the bucket but was peeing herself by the time she grabbed it. She bowed her head in shame as her morning’s coffee and cider spilled down her legs. Her stream tapered off and she pulled her phone back out.

Audrey: Make that three changes of clothes 😅

Part 3

It had been a great shopping trip, but Danielle couldn’t refrain from groaning as she and Emily realized how long the checkout line was. With just two cashiers, the line zigzagged throughout the front of the store with at least two dozen people in front of them. Danielle leaned against the shopping cart begging for the line to somehow pick up the pace.

“Everything alright?” Emily asked.

“This might come as a shock, but I have to pee.”

Emily gasped in fake surprise. “I kinda do too.”

“No ‘kinda’ about mine. But we can manage,” Danielle said.

In her boredom, Danielle texted River after realizing she hadn't seen her in a while. “Busy helping the reporter” was her response. Danielle wished her luck and reminded her to link the Christmas Landing story once it was published. River had looked desperate herself the last time Danielle saw her, but at least she had a way to keep busy rather than being stuck in line.

The line crawled forward at a snail’s pace. Christmas carols looped through the air nonstop and by the third play of All I Want for Christmas is You, Danielle was ready to personally fight Mariah Carey. Apparently, all it took was a full bladder for her to become a Scrooge. Audrey came back by pushing a cart with samples of peppermint hot chocolate. Danielle weighed her options. More liquid was the last thing she needed, but would a 3 oz. sample really make the difference between wetting herself or not? Emily didn’t seem to think so and Danielle didn’t want to clue her in on just how much she was struggling.

The line quickened, but so did Danielle’s bladder. Her first leak came with seven people left. Danielle remained as still as she could and Emily didn’t notice. That changed by her third leak with three people left. Danielle flinched which drew Emily’s attention. Her eyes widened at the small stain that was now visible.

“We’re almost there,” Emily said.

Danielle took a deep breath and nodded. Emily often teased her for her small bladder, but wasn’t in the mood today as she fought her own battle. She lost another spurt, but they were now at the register! Emily graciously put it all on her card for a faster checkout and Danielle handed the cashier items like her life depended on it. Hot chocolate, cider, mugs, a Grinch shirt…

The next leak was the longest one yet, with a small puddle forming beneath her. Emily handed over the last few items and paid. “You still holding it in?” she asked.

“More’s in than out,” Danielle said as they practically sprinted to the car. She tossed her keys to Emily and they shoved everything in the back as fast as they could.

“Closest bathroom?” Emily asked.

“Starbucks,” Danielle said. They just had to sit through one light then they’d be there. Danielle was now up to a softball sized wet patch, but she had faith they could make it. Emily parked and Danielle practically sprinted to the bathroom. She reached the door and froze.

A code was required for the bathroom. Danielle’s face fell and the flood started moments later. Her bladder had hung on valiantly, but this last setback was too much. Her jeans darkened as pee spilled down both pant legs at a near perfect distribution. "She had no doubt she'd happily relive this moment later, but losing control in public a locked door away from relief still stung. Emily entered and cast her a sympathetic smile as she headed to get the bathroom code.

Emily was leaking herself as she witnessed the tail end of Danielle’s accident. She’d cheer her up later, but at the moment her biggest worry was trying not to join her. She hopped from foot to foot as she waited in a line that was thankfully way faster than Christmas Landing's.

“A peppermint mocha, the bathroom code, and my friend uh…” Emily awkwardly looked at Danielle and the barista took it upon herself to apologize on Starbucks’s behalf.

“She’s not the first and sadly she won’t be the last,” the barista finished. Emily paid and booked it to the bathroom. She punched in the code, opened the door, and let Danielle come inside to start cleaning up. Two more leaks escaped and Emily raced to the toilet. She only had time to pull her jeans down before losing control. Pee poured through her green panties and she realized there was little use trying to save them. She sat on the toilet to finish with an exasperated sigh.

Danielle giggled in the corner. “That could’ve gone better.”

“Tell me about it,” Emily laughed.

“Is it weird that I think we should send a picture to River?”

“Nah, she’d find it funny.” The longer Emily thought about it, it was amazing how many of the friend group’s adventures ended in wet pants. She and Danielle struck a pose for the camera with their soaked pants at the forefront. Danielle sent it captioned "Hello darkness".

River laughed reacted in the chat as expected. What Emily didn’t expect was a picture in return. River flashed them the peace sign in her own wet pants with a text below that read "Welcome to the club".

So what happened with Katie coming??

Going to wrap up that part of the story in part 4!

Finale!

Clara took the picture and handed River her phone. “You guys are crazy for sharing this with each other. I’d get roasted into oblivion if people found out I wet myself.”

“It’s a bit of an inside joke with us. Let’s just say we’re not exactly strangers to these situations,” River said.

“I’m glad you can laugh about it. I’ve had wetting issues for most of my life and seeing you goof off is kind of freeing in a way.”

“Huh. Interesting way to think about it,” River said.

Clara looked up at the sound of footsteps as Audrey walked over, pee dripping down her legs. “Oh no! Not you too.”

Audrey sighed. “Yep. But it’s okay! My sister is on the way. I guess while we’re here I can give more quotes for the Ledger.”

“Sure!” Clara said. She asked Audrey about her favorite parts of the job, how busy it got, any deals to highlight, if Die Hard was a Christmas movie and more. River even took her photo, from the waist up of course. This transitioned to small talk which was fun until Megan rounded corner.

“There you are! Audrey, we’ve been out of cider for…” her voice trailed off as she saw the stain on Audrey’s pants. “That was wasn’t cider you spilled on your pants, was it?”

“Nope,” Audrey said.

Megan then looked at Clara and River. “And both of you too. This is a disaster!”

“It’s fine! Katie to the rescue!” A cheery voice said as a blond girl appeared carrying a duffle bag. “Oh my gosh. River!”

River’s face lit up. “I haven’t seen you in months. Audrey mentioned Katie and I had no idea it was you!”

“We’ll have to catch up! But first, everyone go get cleaned up. I can even refill the cider in the meantime.”

“You’re a lifesaver!” Megan told her.

Clara opened the duffel bag, which had three pairs of leggings and panties, some wipes, and a diaper. She blushed at the crinkle of the diaper, but headed to the bathroom to get changed. The toilet had been taken out of the ground to work on pipes, but she found a dry corner. She peeled off her wet clothes and wiped herself down before examining the diaper. It was a store brand adult diaper, but one of the better quality ones. She did the tapes and patted her ass. The whole situation was ridiculous but at least she was comfortable and protected now.

“Better?” River asked as she walked out and Audrey walked in.

“1000%. Once you’re changed, we can enjoy ourselves again.”

Clara headed to the front of the store and thanked Katie while treating herself to another cup of cider. After diapering up, it felt good to enjoy a warm drink risk free. She took a seat beneath Christmas lights and began drafting her piece now that she had plenty of quotes from Audrey, River’s friends, and Santa. River joined her soon afterwards, looking much more refreshed. As Clara wrote, an equally refreshed Audrey took the cider stand back over as River and Katie caught up with each other. Evidently Katie used to be a barista at River’s favorite coffeeshop but now worked at the zoo.

“You ever been to the Goldwood Zoo, Clara?” River asked.

“I actually haven’t.”

“Oh it’s so fun!” Katie said. “They decorate all the exhibits for Christmas and there’s lights everywhere. “Shameless plug, but if the two of you want a follow up…”

“I’d be down!” River said.

Clara couldn’t help but smile at River’s enthusiasm. After their horribly awkward morning, she felt drawn to the friendly photographer. Maybe peeing their pants together created bonds, and her friend group was onto something.

As they made spontaneous plans, Megan approached them with a huge smile. “Just got a call. The porta potties will be here in fifteen minutes!”

“Thank fucking God,” Audrey said. “Oops, that was unprofessional.”

Megan laughed. “On a day like this, I certainly can’t blame you.”

Beneath her cheery demeanor, Megan was struggling. Everything had gone against them this morning, and now that the end was in sight, her body threatened to betray her. She’d been desperate for the past hour as she ran around like a chicken with her head cut off. Growing up, she was one of those people that no one seemed to take seriously. Yet here she was, a small business owner being interviewed by the paper! Santa was here this morning and the Grinch was coming at noon. Once Clara’s story was shared online, people from Ledbetter or Dripping Springs might come visit for the first time. It was the biggest day in Christmas Landing history, yet she was on the verge of wetting herself like a small child. A leak escaped her usually strong bladder and she knew it was getting dire. She walked around the store and saw Erica flag her down. She was practically bouncing behind the register.

“Hey. Kaleb just pulled in. I know the lines are getting long, but can I take a bathroom break as soon as the porta potties arrive?”

Megan’s stomach dropped. What was she supposed to do? Tell her equally desperate employee no? “Oh course. Just go quick.”

“You’re the best!” Erica said while crossing her legs. Kaleb walked in a few minutes later and took over an additional register. Business was going smoothly, even as another leak escaped Megan’s bladder.

She looked out the window and saw salvation. A truck arrived with three blue porta potties. Erica left the line and Megan took over her spot to keep checkout going.

“Oh thank goodness!” A woman in line told her husband. “Hold our spot and I’ll go first.”

Megan watched in horror as nearly half the people in line with a second person headed out to the porta potties. She was now up to a golf ball sized wet spot on her pants. She checked three more people out, but there was no sign of Erica. Her wet patch grew and she had no choice but to call Audrey's cell.

“Hey Audrey.”

“What’s up? Need me somewhere else?”

“Erica went to the bathroom and I’m about to piss myself. Can you take over the register?”

“Of course! Be right there!”

Audrey arrived and Megan sprinted out of the store. The cold wind blasted her and she leaked again. Her heart sank as she saw ten people still in line for the porta potties. Then Megan realized she only had one option left. She ran back inside and found the bathroom at the back of the store. Thankfully, the plumbers hadn’t returned yet. She pulled her pants down and climbed onto the counter before peeing full force into the sink. Even though she had no time to pull her white panties down, it was easily the most blissful pee of her life. She felt ashamed to be in such a compromising situation, but that also felt a bit… naughty? That was weird. She dried her underwear the best she could with paper towels before wrapping them up and burying them in her purse. They were a nice pair after all.

She regained her composure and headed to the front of the store. Kaleb and Audrey still worked the registers while the reporter and photographer chatted with Audrey’s sister while waiting on the Grinch. “Any sign of Erica?”

“Haven’t seen her,” Audrey said. Megan nodded having a feeling she knew what happened. Only two of the three porta potties had customer traffic, so Megan knocked on the third.

“I’ll be out in a minute,” A dejected Erica said.

“Hey it’s Megan. Did you… do I… how do I say this?”

“If you’re asking if I pissed myself, the answer is yes. Not super badly, but there’s still a noticeable stain on my jeans.”

“You stay right there. I’ve got an idea.”

Megan headed inside and got the remaining wipes from Katie. The store didn’t sell traditional clothes aside from T shirts and sweaters, but she could make do with what she had. Megan went to the back closet and found an unopened elf onesie. She returned to the porta potty and gave the items to Erica.

“I can work with this. Best boss ever!”

Megan smiled at the praise, but couldn’t help realizing how good Erica looked in her soaked jeans. Perhaps she’d revisit this crazy morning later…

A new wave of customers arrived closer to noon. Clara interviewed a few more of them for good measure, but by this point, everyone was waiting for the Grinch to arrive. As she finished another cup of cider, her bladder nagged her ever so slightly. She wasn’t desperate, but she’d need to address it soon. “Hopefully in a porta potty this time.”

As small as her bladder was, most of her accidents were overnight. Diapers were more of a safety net for situations like that morning or the endless bathroom line after Goldwood College won a historic basketball upset over Purdue. Wetting herself twice on the same day would be a huge step backwards. Clara considered stepping outside a quarter to noon, but she was having such fun with River and Katie that she stayed inside longer.

The lull in the conversation she was hoping for never came, and soon the Grinch was arriving. A few young kids were scared while others wanted to pet his single antlered dog. River snapped a few pictures of the Grinch and they concluded that the best way to interview him was simply to wait in line and ask a few questions once it was their turn. Clara didn’t mind, but it did push back her planned bathroom break. Her bladder steadily filled as they waited in line.

River noticed something was up as Clara grew quieter. “You good?”

“I have to pee again, but I’ll go after this.”

“Good plan.” River looked like she debated saying more but didn’t want to pry. As they drew closer to the front, Clara thought more about their weird dynamic. Her condition had been a lifelong topic of shame, but after telling a total stranger about it, she felt comfortable. There was something there. They soon reached the front of the line where Clara got a few final quotes to include and Katie took Clara and River’s picture with the Grinch, a perfect shot for the end of the article.

“Okay, I think that’s all we need,” River said once they were done.

“That’s all you need,” Clara corrected. “I need a bathroom.”

Clara headed towards the porta potties and River joined her. Her heart sank as she saw that the line was now up to about twenty people, many being parents with kids. It only took five minutes before Clara felt a familiar warmth in her diaper. It was just a spurt, but it also signaled that a second accident might become a reality. Another leak followed and River noticed her blush.

“Do you think you can hold it?” she whispered.

Clara leaked a third time and counted the people. “I honestly don’t think so.”

“That’s okay. You can just go if you need to.”

Clara’s heart pounded at the suggestion. There was no way she’d reach the porta potty in time. Letting go felt so wrong, but also so right. She relaxed her muscles and her body took over. “I’m peeing.”

Her diaper warmed and swelled instantly as hot urine gushed out of her bladder which was defeated for the second time that day. Since she was standing, both the front and back of the diaper grew saturated. She looked down checking for a leak, but noticed something else entirely. She and River were now holding hands.

“Wow you had to go a lot,” River giggled as she listened.

“Yeah. I had way too much cider. I guess we don’t need to stay in line anymore.”

River paused for a second, but nodded. “I guess not. I’ll drop you off.”

They said bye to Katie before reaching River’s truck just as the plumbers returned. Clara patted her diaper. “I’ll try not to have this thing leak.”

“That wouldn’t be the first time I’ve cleaned pee off the seats,” River shrugged.

“Oh right. You and your friends,” Clara laughed.

“Well, if you ever want to hang out with us, you’ve got that in common,” River said.

Clara smiled as they headed down the road. “That we do.”

River was midway through a story about an ill fated concert she and her friends had attended when traffic ground to a screeching halt. A car had slid off the road, but it didn’t look like anyone was seriously hurt. They heard sirens and eventually police took over, merging three lanes of traffic down to one. Conversation trailed off, but now River was the quieter one.

“Hey Clara…” she said. “Can I use your bathroom once we get there?”

“Of course! And I’m so sorry if you needed it before you left.”

“I’d have made it home just fine without this delay,” River said. That made Clara feel a bit better, even though her new friend’s legs were crossed. After several more agonizing minutes, traffic returned to normal. They eventually hit a red light and River confessed she was leaking.

“Oh no! At least we’re almost there,” Clara said. They pulled in the driveway of her townhouse a few minutes later. She hopped out of the truck and ran to unlock her door. She turned around just in time to see River slip on a patch of ice and totally eat it.

River landed on her ass and laughed. The wipeout was admittedly pretty funny, but Clara soon realized the real reason. Pee gushed out of River’s leggings and pooled around her, forming a noticeable stain even on black leggings. She was soon an island in an ocean of a puddle that spanned most of the front yard's cobblestone path. Clara laughed alongside her as she walked over.

“Almost done,” River said. Clara watched the remnants of her accident run into the grass and helped her up. “So I don’t need your toilet, but is it alright if I use your shower?”

Clara smiled as they headed inside. “Of course you can.”

A week later, Clara waited in her living room clad in a scarf, tacky sweater, and most importantly, a diaper. She and River had met earlier that week for coffee as they finished the Christmas Landing story and it became evident that both were seeking a deeper connection than just a business partner. The doorbell rang and River stood outside. Clara hugged her and grabbed a coat as she climbed into her truck. Two peppermint mochas waited for them in the cup holders.

“Thanks! But given our track records, I hope coffee doesn’t lead to any more accidents,” Clara said.

“I make no promises,” River said with a grin as they headed to the zoo to look at the lights.

Alright Omo friends, hope you enjoyed this one! As I alluded to at the very beginning, a lot my stories feature overlapping characters. Audrey and River are mainstays while Clara was a new addition that I'll definitely be writing more of. Catch you on my next Omo adventure!
