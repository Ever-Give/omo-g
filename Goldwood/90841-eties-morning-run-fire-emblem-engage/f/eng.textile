Etie's Morning Run (Fire Emblem Engage)

Author: Goldwood

*000*2023-07-09 05:57

Etie watched another sunrise at the Somniel. Following the Divine Dragon was hard work, but it certainly had its perks too. The Somniel was beautiful, even if Etie herself felt a bit out of place. She was growing used to it however and Alear had assured her she was welcome to continue her usual exercise habits. She took a long drink of water, and it was time for her morning run.

After leaving the sleeping quarters, Etie made her way around the perimeter of the Somniel. The wind in her hair felt amazing and she could really feel her heart rate get going. Running truly felt freeing. She finished her first lap and took a quick break. It was already shaping up to be a hot day and she made sure to drink plenty of water to help her body replenish what she sweated out. After doing some stretches, she prepared herself for another lap.

Despite taking a break, her second lap didn’t go quite as well as her first. Her pace was slower, and it wasn’t hard to figure out why. Her bladder was steadily filling up as she ran which disrupted her focus a bit. As an advocate for always staying hydrated, urges often came while she ran, but rarely this early. She ran five laps each morning and the earliest she could recall stopping to pee was after the third lap.

“Don’t see why today I'll have to go any sooner,” Etie thought to herself. Perhaps she’d even get some pelvic floor training thrown in as a bonus. She continued her run and found herself passing by the fishing pond. She tried not to focus on the babbling brook that fed the pond but was startled by a splash.

Etie gasped as a trickle of pee leaked into her shorts. Diamant was on the other side of the pond and had just reeled in a fish. “The splash just startled me,” Etie repeated to herself. There wasn’t a noticeable stain, so she kept running. She left the pond and passed by the pool. Alfred was swimming some early morning laps and each of his splashes felt like a knife driven straight into her bladder.

“I am finishing my second lap and then I am peeing!” Etie insisted. Her shorts grew warmer as another leak escaped. There was a now a wet patch on her skirt and she could feel the droplets running down her leggings. She did a few mental gymnastics convincing herself it would just look like sweat until a third leak lasted several seconds forming a round wet spot. There was no use denying it. Etie was on the verge of a full-blown accident!

Her heart pounded as she scanned the horizon for the nearest bathroom. None were close, so she changed plans. A little further down the hill was an oak tree. From what she remembered, there was a patch of bushes in that area that she could use for cover. She hated peeing outside, but this was far from her first time in that scenario. She doubted it would be her last time either. Etie could practically envision herself crouching in the bushes and opening the floodgates already.

Suddenly, she heard voices.

“Man, that was one heck of a party Pandreo!” a hungover Fogado shouted at the base of the hill as he clapped his friend on the back.

“Anytime! Though, maybe not too soon. That was a rare barrel aged mead I smuggled from the palace kitchens. Don’t tell your mother,” Pandreo said with a grin.

“No wonder that was so strong!” Timerra laughed.

Etie’s world slowed down as all six of Alear’s royal guests from Solm rounded the corner and made their way up the hill. They were in no hurry whatsoever after a wild night. Etie waved awkwardly before picking up her pace and praying they were too tired or tipsy to notice the giant stain on her skirt. She cast a fleeting glance at the bushes she'd planned to use, but there was no way she could casually sneak back there with six people in her field of vision. Someone was bound to look back and notice.

Another leak escaped. Her skirt, leggings, and underwear were now thoroughly drenched as she fought against the course of nature. She was now at a full-on sprint. Soon the main building of the Somniel came back into view! Perhaps she could make it after all. She darted past the pool and ignored a warning from Alfred insisting that she slowed down where it was slippery. She didn’t care. Just ahead was her coveted bathroom.

Etie ran to the bathroom and pulled on the door. It didn’t budge. She frantically knocked several times.

“Ugh, just a minute,” Goldmary said from inside. “Did you not learn any manners growing up?”

“Why her? The one person in this place that hates me!”

Etie grimaced as she began to plead. “Please Goldmary. I have to go really bad.”

“That sounds like a “you” problem. I think I’ll take all the time I want,” Goldmary said. “Perhaps I could even take a nice bath while I’m in here.”

“You’re the worst!” Etie said.

Goldmary turned on the water in the tub. “You know the bathtubs here are quite wonderful. Just listen to that. The temperature and pressure are simply perfect.”

The faucet on the tub kept running as Goldmary continued to mock her. She wasn't even bathing! Etie turned to leave, but there was no other bathroom that she had a realistic chance of reaching in time. More pee filled her panties as she banged on the door once more. Goldmary refused to leave.

“This is really happening.”

Etie stifled that leak, but there was no stopping the next one. She gasped in horror as her tired bladder crumpled and the remainder of its contents gushed down her legs in full force. She lifted the front of her skirt to avoid the worst of the flood, but the damage was already done. The stain on the front was already massive, she smelled like pee, and even her black leggings had clear wet streaks when the sun hit her just right. The battle was over. She lost.

The door to the bathroom opened. Goldmary walked out and burst out laughing. “You actually peed yourself! Not even in battle, on just a random day at the Somniel!”

“Shut. Up.” Etie demanded before walking inside and slamming the door.

She cried for a few minutes before taking a deep breath and realizing things weren’t that bad. All the water she drank led to frequent bathroom trips and jokes about her bladder from Alfred and the others anyway. If anyone besides Goldmary had seen her, they probably would’ve just laughed the accident off along with her.

Etie cleaned up and the rest of the day passed uneventfully aside from some snide comments from Goldmary that she did her best to ignore. She headed to her quarters that evening and found a strange bottle in her bag. There was a note next to it.

“Hey Etie,

Sorry about your accident and Goldmary’s antics. I pretended I had a medical condition and talked to Jean. He prescribed this supplement for me claiming it was the strongest diuretic he had access to. Do with it what you will.

- Alfred”

Etie sat on her bed as a massive grin crept onto her face. She didn’t normally think of herself as a petty person, but Goldmary had gone too far. It was time for a little payback.

Hello, I really liked your story, I never thought that Etie would be able to do this, but the truth was a good story, do you think you could do one of Alear woman and Yunaka? or one of Citrine?

Glad you enjoyed it! While not the main pov, I've got a bit of Yunaka here in another fic. I've actually considered a follow up to it featuring Citrinne and Lapis but haven't gotten around to it yet 🙂

Part 2/3. Enjoy!

Etie eyed the tablets that Alfred had given her the following morning. There were twelve tablets in total. She experimentally poured a cup of water and dropped one of the tablets inside. There was a chemical reaction of sorts as the bubbles formed and the tablet dissolved entirely. Etie then noticed a hint of a floral aroma.

“That smells honestly pretty good,” Etie said as Alfred walked in.

“It’s medicine, so the taste has to be appealing. A lot of the people taking this are children.” Alfred said.

“Interesting. So I guess I can spike Goldmary’s drink with a stronger dose,” Etie said.

“There’s actually a problem I just considered. If it has a floral taste, Goldmary will realize right away,” Alfred said.

“What if we slipped it into her tea?” Etie asked.

“Now we’re talking,” Alfred grinned. “We need someone to get her to voluntarily drink it though.”

Etie and Alfred bounced a few ideas off one another. Bunet would be convincing as a professional chef, but would also likely be offended at the mere thought of tampering with food or drinks. Chloe and Celine were sweet enough to propose a “peace offering” of sorts to Goldmary, but their ties to Etie gave reason for suspicion. Eventually the pair wandered to the Somniel kitchens and simply checked the cooking schedule. One name jumped off the page.

“Yunaka would totally do this,” Etie said. Alfred agreed and the plan was set into motion.

Etie knocked on Yunaka’s door later that evening. “Hiya papaya!” Yunaka said. “What brings you here?”

“I’ve got a favor to ask and you seem like the one best suited to it. Have you heard of my feud with Goldmary?” Etie asked.

“Oh yeah. That girl is such a snob! I mostly steer clear of her, but I would be very willing to knock her down a peg,” Yunaka said.

Etie handed over the vial of tablets. “These are a super strong diuretic that should give her some retribution for my err… incident yesterday. A child should take two tablets, so for Goldmary you could slip three, or four, or… probably no more than seven into her tea. There’s a floral flavor and smell produced that should be appealing to her.”

“I love it!” Yunaka said. She shook Etie’s hand and winked as she walked away.

Yunaka could barely sleep that night as she waited for kitchen duty the following day. After growing up as a thief and assassin, the job’s continuous strain on her bladder had awakened a kink within her that she still was in the process of exploring. The prior day’s news of Etie’s accident had left Yunaka desperately wishing she’d caught it in person. If she played her cards right, she’d have a front row seat to witness Etie’s revenge.

She went to the bathroom unable to entertain the mental image of Goldmary pissing herself without acting on it. Once her orgasm subsided, Yunaka washed up and examined the bottle of diuretics. She had eleven tablets to work with. Five tablets into Goldmary’s tea felt like a good number. Then she could give the self-centered girl some remaining ones and watch Goldmary spike herself. Still, she doubted Goldmary would use all six after the tea. Then a brilliant thought occurred to her.

“What if I spiked my own drink and got to experience the desperation alongside Goldmary?” Yunaka thought.

It was risky, but her heart began to race making it clear that there was no ignoring the idea. Yunaka had intentionally held herself until she had accidents before, and the diuretics would essentially act as a catalyst to speed the process up.

Dawn finally came and Yunaka rolled out of bed. She combed her hair but didn’t bother with a bath since she’d inevitably be needing one in the afternoon once the diuretics became too much. Bunet was making breakfast which was great. Fogado insisted that he’d hate to follow up Bunet’s meals, but Yunaka totally disagreed. The blond chef kept the kitchen spotless as he worked and people were usually full meaning that the lunch rush would be easier and later.

“The kitchen is all yours,” Bunet said.

“Wonderful!” Yunaka said. She took a few orders and made some meals before the crown jewel of her plan appeared. Alear had chosen Goldmary and Chloe to have lunch with her and the possibilities of the plan’s execution were endless. What if Goldmary wet herself right in front of the Divine Dragon?

“Good morning!” Yunaka said. “Would the three of you like some tea?”

“That’d be delightful,” Alear said.

“I’d like some too,” Chloe said.

“Only the Somniel’s finest,” Goldmary said.

“Well, I do have a rare kind of tea available with a rich floral aroma. I only have enough for one cup left though. Would anyone like it?” Yunaka asked.

Chloe looked ready to offer it to Alear, but Goldmary giddily clapped her hands. “I’d love some!”

Yunaka took orders for Alear and Chloe before heading back behind the counter. She pulled out the diuretics and dropped five tablets into Goldmary’s mug. The tea bubbled up for a few seconds as Yunaka prepared Alear and Chloe’s drinks. Once Goldmary’s tea had stopped bubbling, Yunaka smelled it. The aroma was awfully pleasing. She’d have never guessed it was medicine. With a shrug, Yunaka dropped two tablets into her water bottle and headed back to the table with the drinks.

“Looks lovely!” Goldmary exclaimed. She took a sip and was instantly elated.

“Taste as good as it looks?” Yunaka asked.

“Even better!” Goldmary said.

As Yunaka took their food orders and prepared the meals, she caught snippets of the conversation. As highly as Goldmary thought of herself, she did seem to suck up to Alear a good deal. Perhaps there was some ammunition there…

“If you’ll excuse me, I will be right back,” Goldmary said. She rounded the corner to the bathroom and Yunaka smiled as she watched other pieces of the plan set into motion.

A smirking Etie stepped out to meet her. “Hello Goldmary, how are you doing this lovely day?”

“Quite well. I was just having tea with the Divine Dragon and drank a little too much rather quickly. Just going to nip into the ladies room avoid the fate of a certain someone that I know,” Goldmary said.

“Oh, unfortunately the cafe bathroom is closed for cleaning. You’ll have to find another one,” Etie said.

“Yeah right,” Goldmary scoffed.

Yunaka grinned as Goldmary walked back a few moments later. Etie had approached her that morning with the idea of getting the cleaning duty to occur during Goldmary’s lunch.

“They are actually cleaning, but I guess I can tough it out unlike you,” Goldmary said to Etie as she sat back down. Yunaka made eye contact with Etie from behind the counter and gave her a thumbs up.

Yunaka fsoon started to squirm as her bladder filled in record time. It was no surprise when she looked over and saw Goldmary sitting with her legs tightly crossed. Alear asked if she was okay a few minutes later and Goldmary reluctantly admitted that the bathrooms had been closed.

“I’ll be fine in a few minutes,” Goldmary said.

Yunaka finished making the food and walked out. She staggered a little at first given the fullness of her bladder, but she kept enough composure to deliver the food without incident. Chloe had ordered potatoes with gravy which allowed Yunaka to play into her quirky persona. She set Chloe’s potatoes down and then pulled out the gravy boat which she proceeded to waterfall onto the mashed potatoes. “Here’s an entire rushing river of gravy for our favorite knight,” Yunaka said with a smile.

Goldmary gasped shortly and then stood up before walking briskly off. Yunaka looked up and her heart skipped a beat. A small wet spot had definitely formed on the crotch of Goldmary’s yellow skirt. Neither Alear nor Chloe acknowledged it, but they had to have noticed given the awkward silence.

“Do either of you need anything? I’m about to take a quick break myself,” Yunaka asked Alear and Chloe.

“A glass of water to go with this meal and tea would be great,” Alear said. Chloe echoed the sentiment.

“Right on it!” Yunaka said. She walked back into the kitchen and grimaced when she saw the pitcher was empty. She hopped from foot to foot as the pitcher filled before pouring the first glass. She had to fight her bladder, but she poured the glass. She started to fill the second glass when her bladder leaked. It wasn’t a few drops either. It was a spurt lasting several seconds that took some time to cut off. She grabbed a dishrag, tied it around her waist, and marched back to the table to deliver the waters.

Alear and Chloe thanked her before Yunaka darted off to the bathroom.

Goldmary was in uncharted territory. Everything had been going right for her. It was a beautiful day at the Somniel, and she’d been invited to lunch with Alear. Her hair, makeup, and outfit were perfect, and she’d discovered a new favorite tea. Yet her always trustworthy bladder threatened to ruin it. She didn’t understand it. She could regularly hold for hours at a time even when her bladder was full. She’d gone before lunch like usual, but thirty minutes later she was on the verge of… pulling an Etie!

She saw Yunaka get in line behind her out of the corner of her eye. The red-haired girl looked quite desperate herself. Goldmary leaked again and frantically tried to stop it. She did, several seconds later than she wanted. Her skirt’s wet spot was now the size of an orange. She banged on the women’s bathroom door frantically.

“Let me in. Let me in!” Goldmary shouted!

“Cleaning. I’ll be out in a minute,” Fogado said from inside.

Goldmary turned to Yunaka wide eyed. “I’m not sure I have a minute. I…” A shameful thought crossed her mind as another leak escaped and several more droplets worked their way down her legs. Legs shaking, she turned to Yunaka. “Pretend you didn’t see this.”

Goldmary took off running and threw the bathroom door to the men’s room wide open. She ripped her leggings down as she ran and threw herself on top of the nearest chamber pot. Pee gushed and gushed until the pot nearly overflowed! She looked up in horror and made eye contact with Yunaka. She hadn’t even shut the door!

“Close the door you creep!” Goldmary screamed as Yunaka frantically apologized while leaking pee into her pants and slammed the door. The slam created a draft which caused the chamber pot to wobble sending several splashes onto her already damp leggings. Eventually Goldmary’s heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal. Then she realized she’d left her handbag outside the bathroom in her haste. Goldmary grimaced as she walked back outside. She sprayed herself down with perfume as Yunaka walked out of the ladies’ room with a watermelon sized stain on her pants.

“Good day to wear black pants!” Yunaka said.

Goldmary screamed internally before sighing heavily. “Let’s just get back to lunch.”

She walked back and tried to regain her composure. She cringed as Alear and Chloe both looked quite concerned. “Are you okay Goldmary?” Alear asked.

“I’m fine, Divine One. I just wasn’t feeling well for a moment, but I’m doing better. Fortunately, I ordered a salad so the only thing that may have gone cold is the chicken. Yunaka, could you be a dear and…”

“On it!” Yunaka said walking over and scooping Goldmary’s chicken onto a plate to take inside and reheat.

Goldmary looked across the courtyard and her heart dropped as she saw Etie and Alfred sipping tea a few tables over while Fogado and Pandreo mopped the floor around some unused tables. “They’re too far away to notice the state of my outfit. Right? Right?” Not that she cared what a low-life pants wetter like Etie thought about her of course.

Yunaka returned a few minutes later with the chicken and a few tablets on the side. “Sorry you’re not feeling well, Goldmary. If it makes you feel any better, I found a few more of the tablets that gave your tea the floral flavor you loved. I think they’d be perfect to flavor your water bottle.

“That’s a great idea,” Goldmary said.

Chloe perked up. “Um, Goldmary. If you don’t mind, could I try the other two tablets?”

Yunaka insisted that it might be better for Goldmary to use all four while she tried to find four more for Chloe, but Alear’s presence at the table left Goldmary feeling trapped.

Reluctantly, she told Yunaka not to worry as she dropped two tablets into her water bottle and handed the others to Chloe. She took a few sips while eating her salad and discussing Alear’s plans to find the remaining Emblem Rings. The flavored water tasted refreshing and Chloe liked hers too.

Suddenly, Celine ran into the café and nearly crashed into a table. The Corrupted returned. Florra is under attack!”

Everyone in the cafe began to panic as Alear quickly instructed them to follow her to Florra. There wasn’t a moment to spare. As she left the Somniel, Goldmary felt two things. The first was worry towards the people of Florra. The second was the realization that she already had to pee again.

A/N: Wasn't expecting this to get so long, but I hope you enjoyed! Part 3 of this and then the Citrinne/Lapis story should be the next two omo things I write. While this cast is newer and less developed than Three Houses, I hope I did a decent job keeping them in character. At least to me, Yunaka's whole *vibe* just feels like some who'd be into omo 😉

Part 3/3. Despite planning a battle, multiple wettings, and a conclusion, I still underestimated how long this would take! Go figure

Goldmary already felt a few slow leaks into her leggings as the group arrived in Florra. The sudden nature of the attack had forced Alear to grab everybody in her immediate vicinity: Goldmary, Chloe, Etie, Alfred, Yunaka, Fogado, Pandreo, and Celine. It was honestly a decent mix of skillsets for such a hastily thrown together bunch. The town was being stormed by about twenty Corrupted which wielded a variety of weapons. More were coming on the horizon. Goldmary felt her usual pre-battle nerves wash over her and for a moment was almost thankful that her full bladder lessned her nerves as she focused on bodily needs.

“You four, take the right side,” Alear said pointing to Goldmary, Yunaka, Etie, and Alfred. Goldmary and Etie glared at one another, but there were far more pressing matters at hand than their squabbles.

Alfred took the lead on horseback and began to hack away at a group of Corrupted with his lance. Goldmary and Yunaka ran after him while Etie shot down any backup that tried to come from the air. There was a flash of light as Alfred summoned Embelm Sigurd and tore through several foes at once in a single move. Goldmary, Yunaka, and Etie were ready for cleanup.

“Scatter like petals!” Etie shouted as her bow punched through an encroaching Corrupted sending the foul creature smashing into the wall of the nearest house. Goldmary took down a Corrupted of her own without too much difficultly, but her weight distribution in those fencing strokes really strained her bladder. To her right, Yunaka threw one knife, but uncharacteristically missed her follow up attack. Goldmary looked over and saw her fidgeting with crossed legs.

“Are you okay? Goldmary asked as she cut down the enemy Yunaka missed.

“I really have to pee again!” Yunaka said with a blush. “And honestly you don’t look so great yourself.”

Goldmary recoiled in horror at the notion of her being viewed as anything less than perfect, but it was hard to blame Yunaka for noticing. “I um… also need to go,” Goldmary stammered.

“Now that’s interesting,” Etie said. “I could’ve sworn you just peed right before we left the Somniel. You too Yunaka, actually.”

“What are you are the bathroom supervisor or something?” Goldmary snapped.

“If you’re going to wet yourself twice in the same day, we might as well employ one!” Etie insisted.

“That’s enough,” Alfred said. “Let’s just go find Alear.”

Goldmary followed, but both she and Yunaka were nearly waddling as they crossed the battlefield trying to keep dry. Yunaka grabbed Goldmary’s arm. “Cover me. I’m going to go pee in that flower bed.”

“I will if you return the favor afterwards,” Goldmary said. Both girls shuffled over to the closest flower bed. Goldmary bit her lip and prepared to block out the sight and sound of Yunaka peeing. Yunaka had just yanked her pants down when three Corrupted came scrambling down from the top of the house behind them. Both Goldmary and Yunaka screamed as their fight-or-flight instincts kicked in.

As soon as Goldmary picked her sword back up, she began urinating in full force. As far as she was concerned, an entire river was pouring out of her defeated bladder. She peed and peed completely unable to stop the flow as her other reflexes were needed to fight. Her clothes which hadn't even fully dried after her close scare at the Somniel were completely soaked. She reached under her skirt and was mortified at the sheer volume of pee she was able to wring out of her panties.

"Wettings are for small children and low-lifes like Etie! Not me!" She blinked a few times hoping she was in a dream, but nothing happened.

Goldmary looked over at Yunaka. Yunaka had started an almost equally strong stream while fending off Corrupted with her pants still down from her attempt to pee. Her red panties were completely soaked and her pants were lying at her feet in a puddle that was in the process of merging with Goldmary’s to create a golden lake. Both women each took out one Corrupted before Etie knocked out the third with a well placed arrow.

“What was that?” Etie demanded as she and Alfred approached joined by Chloe and Pandreo. “Alfred and I nearly got overwhelmed because you ditched us!”

“Not cool,” Pandreo said. “I could barely get them in range of a Physic spell if something serious went wrong.”

Goldmary stammered trying to explain, but fell short as Chloe took over the conversation.

“Um, Yunaka. Your pants…” Chloe whispered. Her legs were shaking, but Goldmary couldn’t tell if it was nerves or her bladder.

Goldmary went crimson as Yunaka pulled her pants up causing everyone to notice her legs as well. “I’m so sorry. We had to—”

Suddenly without warning another strong stream of pee poured down Goldmary’s legs. She hadn’t even felt that one!

“Stop doing that! You’re going to make me go again too!” Yunaka complained.

“You risked your teammates lives because you had to pee? Are you serious?” Alfred asked.

“I’ve got a bladder infection or something!” Goldmary wailed. “I didn’t even feel that last accident. I know that was super unprofessional of me and Yunaka, but I’ve never struggled with these issues so badly.”

“Then maybe you should wear a diaper next time,” Etie said with a smirk. Alfred grinned and Yunaka even looked intrigued at the idea!

Suddenly something clicked. Within a few minutes, Etie had gone from fearing for her life to mocking Goldmary over her lack of bladder control. “You did something!” Goldmary shouted. “I know it!”

The panicked expressions from Etie and Alfred confirmed what she needed. Heart pounding, Goldmary shoved Etie against the wall. Alfred tried to break them up, but Pandreo cast Freeze on all three parties before calling Alear over.

“What is going on?” Alear asked as Pandreo unfroze them. “Are we fighting the Corrupted or ourselves?”

“Both,” Etie confessed. “I… we… may have done some suspect things.”

“Who is we?” Alear asked.

“Me, Alfred, and Yunaka. We spiked Goldmary’s tea with a diuretic trying to get payback on her,” Etie said.

“It was really petty and stupid,” Alfred said.

As furious as Goldmary was at Etie and Alfred, her first instinct was to address Yunaka. “Wait. You were in on it too? You’ve been nearly as desperate as me this whole time!”

“I thought it would be less suspicious if I spiked my own drink too,” Yunaka said. “Bad idea.”

“So what was the drug?” Goldmary asked.

“The tablets with the floral taste,” Yunaka said.

“Oh no! I dissolved those in my water. Then Alear drank half of it after the Corrupted destroyed her canteen!" Chloe gasped.

Etie, Alfred, and Yunaka traded pained glances as Fogado and Celine announced another wave of Corrupted were coming.

“We’ll be fine. Let’s just hold it in long enough to finish this battle,” Alear said.

Etie felt incredibly guilty as the party resumed battle. Goldmary got what she deserved, but her plan had caught way more people in the crossfire than she intended. Alear twitched way more than usual as she walked, and Chloe was visibly shaking atop her pegasus. Etie notched several arrows and made key shots against the enemy, but her mind and heart weren’t in it after getting called out by Goldmary.

A magic wielding Corrupted cast a spell that knocked Chloe out of her saddle. She was flying low to the ground, but was still slow to get up. With Chloe’s Pegasus vulnerable, Alear engaged with Emblem Lucina and began to combo attack that most of the party participated in while Etie helped Chloe to her feet. The blue-haired knight was shaking as she made her way to her mount.

“Are you okay?” Etie asked.

“I have to pee so bad,” Chloe said. She hopped up and down for a bit before her face fell. “Oh no!”

“We’ll find cover,” Etie told her. “Get over there and you can lift your skirt up to—”

“Too late!” Chloe shouted. A surge of pee began spilling out of her already damp skirt and soaking into her leggings. She managed to hike her skirt up and spread her legs, but it was evident that her blue panties were beyond saving. Even though Chloe had only received a partial dose, she still peed for quite a long time.

Etie grimaced as she noticed her own bladder for the first time that fight. She fended off a few Corrupted that tried to reach Chloe as Goldmary and Alear returned leading her pegasus. There was a noticeable wet spot on Alear’s pants as she approached, which Etie felt bad about.

Goldmary looked from Chloe to Etie with folded arms. “I hope you’re happy with how this turned out.”

Etie sighed until an idea crossed her mind. It was ridiculous in truth, but it was as good as an olive branch as she could hope to offer in the current circumstances. “Obviously I didn’t expect any of this, but we’re well past that point. Goldmary, give me your water bottle.”

Goldmary handed it over with a puzzled expression. Etie took a deep breath and downed the remainder of the water. “You realize what’s in there, right?” Goldmary said.

Etie nodded. “I do. Even if you were rude to me the other day, I went way too far. I hope this makes us even.”

“Really weird gesture, but I appreciate the thought,” Goldmary said. “Have fun holding it!” She sarcastically blew a kiss and headed back into the fight.

Fogado approached looking confused. “I have many questions, but in other news we’re down to the final wave.”

Alear let out a relieved sigh as the wet spot on her pants grew again. “Great. You two come with me.”

Etie did just that as the last group of Corrupted invaded Florra. Her legs buckled under the pressure of her rapidly filling bladder but she fought through the pain. Two axe wielding Corrupted broke through the group’s front ranks prompting Pandreo and Celine to start healing. Alear dove for one of the Corrupted and delivered a massive blow that knocked it back. Etie shot the Corrupted down and Fogado hit the second Corrupted. The beast tumbled backwards and crashed down on top of Alear.

Alear screamed as she tried to wiggle out from underneath the beast’s weight. Fogado switched to a sword and finished off the Corrupted. Alear had been saved, but her bladder had not. As she sat on the ground, there was a hissing sound as a torrent of urine spilled out of her. Etie tried to look away but was simply drawn to it in awe. She rarely saw Alear pee given what she suspected to be some kind of magical stamina ability and the thought of her wetting herself was never something that Etie would’ve never seen coming. Just how strong were the diuretics Alfred had supplied her with?

“That was embarrassing of me,” Alear said before simply dusting herself off and getting up.

“These things happen in battle,” Etie said as she felt her first serious leak of the afternoon. She, Alear, and Fogado rejoined the rest of the group where the battle was winding down. Etie managed to take out a few more Corrupted as her bladder leaked, but when a blast of magic from the last one knocked her on her ass, Etie knew she was done for. She suddenly felt very warm as the floodgates opened and pee gushed out. She saw the final Corrupted fall in her peripheral vision and made no effort to get up. There was no stopping her bladder so she opted to sit there and enjoy the relief.

Etie heard footsteps as Goldmary walked over, skirt freshly soaked from another accident. Goldmary looked down at Etie and nodded before offering her hand. “I guess we’re even.”

Etie took her hand as she got to her feet. “I think so.”

Once order was restored to Florra, the group returned to the Somniel. After washing up, Alear pulled Etie, Goldmary, Alfred, and Yunaka aside to make sure all the drama from the past few days had wrapped up. Goldmary vowed not to tease Etie for her small bladder or hog the bathroom until she wet herself. Etie, Alfred, and Yunaka assured Alear they wouldn’t do anything crazy. They went to find Jean, but the young physician was unable to find anymore diuretic tablets making the thought of a similar event unfolding a non-issue. Alear and Yunaka left while the other three went for a jog.

“That was quite a run,” an exhausted Goldmary told Etie and Alfred afterwards. “But next time, I will keep up with you the entire way!”

Etie grinned. “You have a nice night. We’re going to do two more laps before bed.”

“I knew you were crazy,” Goldmary said with a laugh.

“Well, all’s well that end’s well. Maybe we’ll even be friends with her,” Alfred said.

Etie smiled. “Wouldn’t that be something?”
