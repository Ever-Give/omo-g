Tea Time Gone Awry (Fire Emblem Three Houses)

Birds chirped outside as Byleth adjusted her position on the picnic blanket. It was a lazy day off during the Garland Moon and after a few days of rain, it seemed the entire monastery was out enjoying the spring weather. Although Byleth was still warming up to her new role as a teacher, she seemed to be quite popular among her students and made it her goal to get to know each of them better. She started with Dorothea since she was the most outgoing and somewhere along the way, it turned into a girls’ day out for all the Black Eagles.

As a result, Byleth sat cross legged joined by Edelgard, Dorothea, Petra, and Bernadetta. They’d eaten most of the meat, cheese, and crackers along with a few pastries. But the part of the meal that stole the show was the tea. It was a refreshing berry blend that was sweet, but not too sweet, and tasted absolutely refreshing on a spring day. Byleth finished her second mug as Dorothea cast Fire to heat up another kettle.

“This tea is truly amazing Professor,” Dorothea said as she began to pour another mug.

“I am liking it quite a lot,” Petra said echoing the sentiment.

“Truly, we should do this more often,” Edelgard said.

“It’s been a lovely afternoon,” Byleth agreed.

“You didn’t have many friends as a mercenary, did you?” Dorothea asked as she poured Byleth a third mug.

“Not really. I had coworkers that I got along with my, but those relationships were business first.”

“Well, that can change now that you’re here at the monastery,” Dorothea said.

“Dorothea. She is our professor first and foremost,” Edelgard reminded.

“I am. But it has been nice enjoying your company,” Byleth said. She turned to the edge of the group where Bernadetta played with a few blades of grass. “Is everything alright, Bernadetta?”

“I’m fine!” Bernadetta said jolting up. “Just totally fine. This is great, really.”

Byleth eyed the shy purple haired girl. “Are you sure? This a safe place to be honest.”

“It’s been a nice day. I guess I’m not used to being outdoors this long,” Bernadetta said quickly. As she spoke, Byleth noticed her knee bouncing up and down. When Dorothea retook control of the conversation, Byleth cast a glance back in Bernadetta’s direction. She shifted back and forth and pressed her hand into her crotch. Her eyes widened as they made awkward eye contact.

“Bernadetta has to pee,” Byleth realized. It had been nearly two hours since the group arrived and the kettle sitting in the grass, now empty for the second time, made for an easy culprit. She hated to end things when the others were enjoying their time, but poor Bernadetta had a track record of being too shy to speak up about such matters.

Byleth resolved to wait for a natural break in the conversation to start wrapping things up. It was a plan that made sense in theory but didn’t quite work. Dorothea went on a long rant about how weird and creepy Lorenz was, which both Edelgard and Petra could vouch for. Bernadetta rocked nervously and by this point in the meal, she clearly wasn’t alone. Petra’s legs were tightly crossed, and she now sat on her hands. Dorothea was always an expressive person who used her whole body when talking, but her leg was also bouncing. Edelgard retained her composure but shifted subtly and took deep breaths when she thought Byleth wasn’t looking. As she noticed everyone’s state, Byleth could fill her own bladder fill. Perhaps she hadn’t needed that third mug.

Byleth was midway through explaining that she’d talk to Lorenz about his behavior when a wave of desperation slammed into her. She froze for a second as she adjusted her posture and tried to regain her train of thought. Growing up as a mercenary, Byleth had become accustomed to holding her piss. As far as she could tell her bladder wasn’t particularly large, but she knew how to make every drop count.

“Is everything okay?” Edelgard asked. Her usually hard demeanor softened as she looked at Byleth while crossing her legs.

“I’m fine. I just got distracted for a second. I thought I saw… a big spider,” Byleth said. It was far from the most convincing lie, but it was enough for Bernadetta to frantically stand up while Petra looked for it.

“Spiders are friends of the tree spirits. Please do not be squishing them,” Petra said.

Out of the corner of Byleth’s eye, Sothis appeared. The green haired spirit hopped from foot to foot while glaring at Byleth. “Why are you humans so bad about handling your bodily needs! Your bladder’s bursting and now poor Bernadetta might wet herself because she’s scared of a fake spider!”

“I’ll get out of this,” Byleth thought.

“Well, you’d better find a solution quick. My desperation is tied to yours and I’m not enjoying this!” Sothis winked out view and Byleth grit her teeth. The bond between her and Sothis had plenty of quirks and their linked bladders were a prime example. Why should a ghost, spirit, whatever she was, have a bladder anyway?

“I don’t think I actually saw a spider now that I think about it. It may have been just a trick of the light,” Byleth said. She felt a stab of desperation as she began to rock in place as well.

That seemed to calm Bernadetta down. Just when Byleth was convinced she was in the clear, Dorothea shot her a sly smile. “Is that really why you got distracted Professor B? Or was it something else?”

“She’s onto me. And everyone else,” Byleth realized. A spurt of pee escaped and she did everything in her power to stay composed around her students.

“Dorothea! What are you even insinuating?” Edelgard said.

“She has to pee! We all do!” Dorothea said. “No use being weird about it.”

Byleth blushed. “This has been a great time, but as Dorothea candidly put, all that tea has definitely made its presence known. Let’s head back to the monastery.”

“Thank the Goddess!” Bernadetta exclaimed.

Byleth shoved her tea set in the basket followed by the blanket and leftover food. It was a decent walk back to Garreg Mach, but one they could definitely endure if they moved quickly.

Or so Byleth thought. The five of them started down the road, but only made it a few bends in the trail before Bernadetta cried out.

“I’m leaking! Another one! Oh no…”

A pang of sympathy distracted Byleth from her own desperation as Bernadetta lost control a few steps behind her. It was hard to see the stain on her black skirt, but Byleth definitely heard the stream and saw the streaks of pee that snaked down her legs. “This is so embarrassing!” she wailed.

“It’s okay Berni,” Dorothea said giving her a hug.

“I’m… really sorry Bernadetta,” Byleth said for lack of anything better. “We have to keep moving though.”

Petra hit her limit a little further up the road. “I will not be holding it. Can I go in the bushes?” Her face burned in embarrassment, and a damp patch on her tan skirt said she wasn’t lying.

“You can. Honestly, I really should have thought about this solution for us sooner,” Byleth said. She started to yank her pants down when the clop of hooves made her panic. Byleth pulled her pants up just in time for a farmer on horseback to ride by. The man waved to them and whistled, completely oblivious to sight he nearly witnessed.

Byleth turned to her students. Edelgard and Dorothea seemed to be holding up okay, but Petra completely pissed herself the moment the farmer was out of sight. Her light-colored outfit hid nothing as the flood started and lasted what had to be over a minute.

“At least my bladder is empty now,” Petra said.

“Two down, three to go!” Dorothea giggled.

“Dorothea!” Edelgard said. A few leaks had already darkened her red pants.

“Can you make it to the monastery dry?” Byleth asked.

“I think our only choice is to try. We’re only going to encounter more people.” Edelgard said.

“What if we run into people we know! They can’t see me like this!” Bernadetta stammered.

“Just blend into the crowd and walk with confidence. Where’s the first bathroom we’ll see again?” Dorothea asked.

“The stables,” Byleth said.

“Then let’s hurry,” Edelgard said.

Sothis appeared again. “You should have just risked it and peed when your pants were down!”

“Flashing random travelers sounds like a great way to get fired.”

“Like they’d know who you are!

“I’m literally wearing my officer’s academy cloak. Plus, with my luck that would’ve been Seteth passing by.”

“Are you sure you don’t want that? I’ve listened to some of your thoughts about him,” Sothis teased.

“You are not helping!” Byleth thought. She tried to block out Sothis when the unthinkable happened.

First she saw it. A dark stain appeared on Sothis’s robes as pee came pouring out. Then Byleth felt it herself. Her mouth went dry and her legs quivered as she lost complete control of her body. Three mugs of tea came pouring out of her tortured bladder instantly soaking her underwear and shorts. While comfy and breathable, her choice of fashion meant that almost every inch of clothing below her waist was completely drenched in pee.

Sothis glared at Byleth. “We peed ourselves! Nice going! And watch the basket!”

In her shock from the accident, Byleth lost her grip on the picnic basket. There was a blur of red and black as Edelgard frantically dove for it. The kettle and pots clinked, but it didn’t sound like any serious damage to the tea set. Dorothea cheered for Edelgard, but her voice awkwardly trailed off a few seconds later. A massive puddle spread out underneath Edelgard as she wet herself lying on her side and lifting the basket to spare it from the puddle. Her red leggings were now maroon.

“Dang Edie. You and Professor B each had a whole ocean in there,” Dorothea giggled.

“Does anyone else think Dorothea’s enjoying this a little too much?” Edelgard asked.

“I’m just having a great time with my friends,” Dorothea said blowing Edelgard a kiss. “But since everyone else went…”

There was a steady trickle as Dorothea unleashed the contents of her bladder. Whereas everyone else had been embarrassed to lose control, Byleth couldn’t help but admire the confidence with which Dorothea voluntarily let go. Much like herself, she could tell Dorothea had developed a immense holding capacity from her days as an opera star. While desperate, it seemed like Dorothea could’ve made it back to the monastery dry if she wanted to.

“If she wanted to.”

Byleth found some less than proper thoughts creeping into her mind that she hadn’t felt since she had an accident in her mercenary days. Perhaps she’d revisit them later.

“Well, I’m sorry this was how everything ended today,” Byleth said.

“I still liked it mostly,” Petra said. The others echoed the sentiment.

“Honestly, it made quite the memories,” Edelgard said.

Dorothea nodded. “We should do this again. Well maybe not the peeing part. Unless…?”

"No!"

Byleth couldn’t help but laugh. “We’ll do this again. But perhaps I’ll choose a spot closer to a bathroom next time.

The walk back to Garreg Mach was strangely carefree given the ridiculousness of the situation. Byleth bid farewell to her students and headed straight to her room. By the time she'd drawn up a bath, a second wave of desperation was already on the way after breaking the seal with her accident. She stepped in the tub, but rather than undressing, she voluntarily wet her clothes. The relief was almost as good as earlier and it was interesting seeing the two shades of urine on her shorts. Byleth felt herself orgasm soon afterwards. Once that subsided, she turned and found herself face to face with Sothis, dripping wet for the second time that day.

"You humans are disgusting."

"We are. But I might as well enjoy it."

The classic situation for a three houses omo fic, tea time! I liked this take on it, and how Byleth and maybe Dorothea ended up enjoying it.

Oh Dorothea definitely enjoyed it 😉
