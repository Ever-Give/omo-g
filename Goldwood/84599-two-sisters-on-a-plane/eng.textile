Audrey loved flying as a kid. It meant the start of an exciting new trip and things such as breakfast at the airport and waking up at weird hours of the night to catch their early morning flight just added to the experience. As a 22 year old college student, most of those thoughts still rang true, on the departure trip anyway. By her return flight, she was exhausted and just wanted to get home as fast as possible. 

Audrey found herself at a busy airport waiting on her return flight alongside her sister, Katie. Both girls were on their way back to Goldwood for the start of the spring semester. Christmas and New Years had been nice, but their time as guests had run its course and Audrey was definitely ready to get away from her parents. And Katie. When Katie first told Audrey she was also committing to Goldwood College, Audrey laughed thinking it was a joke. They butted heads constantly and Audrey assumed she would take college as her opportunity to branch out of her older sister’s shadow. Katie explained that she originally had planned on it, but a sizable biochemistry scholarship said otherwise. Goldwood College did have a great program for that after all. The result led to very different sisters waiting for the same plane. Audrey wore her favorite black hoodie and tweaked her Spotify playlist while Katie sat working on an adult coloring book in a pink blouse and white jeans while her blonde hair was tied back. 

Audrey’s phone buzzed and Katie sighed having received the same message. Their flight was pushed back an hour. She was almost certain that would happen given the winter weather in Goldwood, but their Dad insisted on dropping them off at the airport two and a half hours early no matter what. 

“Want to get coffee to pass the time?” Audrey asked. 

“Sure!” Katie said. 

The line at the airport’s Dunkin Donuts was long, but there was plenty of time to kill so neither sister minded. They were in an atrium of sorts with plenty of plants and an indoor fountain which made for interesting scenery. 11:00 hit and the fountain turned off momentarily before shooting a spout of water high up in the air as some sort of hourly feature. By the time the fountain returned to normal, Audrey felt a twinge in her bladder. They’d been at the airport for several hours, so she made a note to pee after she was done with her coffee. In line, she saw Katie swaying from side to side. Perhaps she needed to go as well. 

By the time Audrey reached the counter, their flight was delayed an extra half hour so she opted to get a 24 oz. iced coffee and sip on that for the next hour. Katie bought one the same size and they headed to find a table at the food court. 

“This thing is massive, and I love it,” Katie said. “But first I think I’m going to go make room.” She set her drink down and headed off looking for a bathroom confirming Audrey’s suspicions. Given Katie’s history it wasn’t surprising. The younger sister had a bedwetting problem well into her teenage years was always the first person to pee at the movies or on family road trips. Audrey and her friends had made fun of her once when she was 16 and Katie was 14, but she genuinely felt awful afterwards and was happy once Katie finally got over it. Audrey in contrast had been blessed with a large bladder, yet cursed by being incredibly pee shy. Back when she worked her seasonal Halloween job, she’d routinely held her pee for entire shifts. She would’ve gotten away with it, if not for a fateful Halloween night where she drank two water bottles and conceded to wetting her pants after four hours of holding. 

Katie reappeared about ten minutes later. “Long line in there.” 

Audrey frowned at that news. “I was going to wait till I finished this, but I guess I’ll go now just in case.” 

“Smart planning,” Katie said. 

Audrey grinned. “That’s why I wasn’t the one in diapers for my fifteenth birthday.” 

“Rude!” Katie said. “In fact, I hope the line is so long that you pee your pants waiting.” 

Audrey sarcastically held up heart hands as she made her way to the bathroom. Her sister certainly wasn’t lying about the line. After about a third of her coffee, she was incredibly desperate and hopped from foot to foot in a line of ten adult women and a few kids. There were four stalls in the bathroom with one in use by someone who had to do more than pee based on the time taken. 

Two of the women in front of Audrey were perhaps even more desperate than she was. The first was an African American girl around her age with curly hair. She tapped her foot both very fast and very loud. As Audrey squirmed in line, her own tapping foot eventually synched up. Both Audrey and the other girl blushed as a girl who looked around five declared “they have to pee pee just like Mommy.” The little girl’s mother was a brunette with glasses who looked roughly in her late twenties or early thirties. Her legs were knotted and her hands pressed against her stomach when they weren’t hanging onto her kid. Her daughter eventually broke her grip and ran off to the paper towel dispenser. It was a apparently her first encounter with a motion sensor dispenser and she waved her arms to send out about five paper towels her mother ran out and grabbed her. As the woman bent down to pick up her daughter’s mess, Audrey caught a glance of white fabric. For a moment she thought it was a diaper, but she recognized it as one of those incontinence pads she saw on TV. She wondered if the pad was already damp. 

Audrey wound up wishing she had a protective pad of her own as the line continued to drag. A second stall was filled up by someone pooping and Audrey, the curly haired girl, and the young mom all squirmed in line. The curly haired girl had stopped tapping her foot in effort to keep her jeans dry. That appeared to be going well until Audrey heard her gasp. She looked over and saw a small stain at the crotch of her jeans. Seeing that seemed to inspire Audrey’s own bladder to leak. She panicked for a few seconds until she got her stream under control. A stall opened and the curly haired girl dashed past the three people in front of her and slammed it shut. Having seen her desperation none of the women in front of her were even that mad. 

“Excuse me, can I go in front of you?” the young mother asked Audrey. 

Audrey froze for a few seconds trying to politely tell her that she was desperate herself, but caved after a few desperate pleas. The brunette thanked her profusely and good willed strangers let her be next in line. Just when it looked like she was in the clear, the flush of a toilet was the last straw. The woman’s knees buckled and pee came gushing out. She tried to stem the flow but it did no good and comments from her daughter about “Mommy needs diapers” only embarrassed her further. As another spurt burst out of Audrey, she wondered what it felt like in the other woman’s shoes. She’d come prepared, but not prepared enough. Her pad had to be drenched after making its last stand. Had she been in any other predicament, Audrey would’ve gone to comfort her. 

Audrey finally bit the bullet and tried to move up in line. Two women let her past while the third said “Sorry two is enough and I’ve got to go.” Fair. Now that her desperation was known, Audrey had no reason to care about modesty. She was full on dancing by the time a stall opened for her. She yanked down her leggings and raced to the toilet. She couldn’t fully pull her panties down in time and they took part of the spray as a result. She sat on the bowl and threw her head back in exhaustion. She’d mostly made it. The fewer questions Katie asked, the better. 

After dabbing her pants and panties with toilet paper, she washed her hands as thoroughly as possible and left the bathroom. Katie was at the same table blissfully unaware of the hell her sister just went through. Their flight got pushed back another 30 minutes and both sisters relaxed at the food court enjoying their coffee. 

Forty-five minutes passed. Katie went to the bathroom again and Audrey was beginning to consider going a second time if she found better line luck. Audrey’s phone buzzed suddenly. Their flight hadn’t been delayed as long as the app expected and would board in five minutes! Katie came out a few minutes later. 

“Long line that time?” Audrey asked. 

“Oh not too bad,” Katie said. 

“Good. Guess I’ll just wait to go again during the flight at this point,” Audrey said. 

All passengers for the flight boarded smoothly. Katie sat by the window, Audrey took the middle seat and a middle aged man sat on the aisle seat across from his wife and two kids. Audrey was beginning to idly flip through bad airline TV when the pilot’s voice rang over the intercom. 

“Attention passengers. We are experiencing high wind delays. Expect to stay on the ground for about fifteen more minutes,” he said. 

Fifteen minutes inevitably turned into thirty and the remainder of Audrey’s coffee began to nag her. Just as she contemplated asking the man beside her to let her out, the delay was lifted and the plane began to move. She turned to Katie as the fasten seatbelt sign came on. Her sister was grimacing with legs tightly crossed. 

“Are you okay?” Audrey whispered. 

Katie shook her head. “I didn’t get a chance to pee that second time. The line was too long and I was scared to miss boarding.” 

“Oh no,” Audrey said. “You drank that huge coffee and haven’t gone in about…” 

“Two hours,” Katie whispered. 

“Well if it makes you feel any better, I have to go too,” Audrey said. 

Katie took a deep breath. “Well, this flight is about to get interesting.” 

Audrey nodded as the plane rocketed down the runaway and eventually took flight. Her ears popped and her bladder filled while the fasten seatbelt sign taunted them overhead.
