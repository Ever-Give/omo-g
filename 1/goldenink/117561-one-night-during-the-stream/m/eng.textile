Caleb leaned back in his computer chair, taking a long drag from his joint, lidded green eyes on his monitor. He had two in his set up, plus a rainbow, back lit keyboard, all glowing in his dark bedroom, complimenting the blue LED light strips on his ceiling. He exhaled the smoke, feeling more relaxed at the warmth it left behind.

Caleb was a gaming live streamer in his early 20s who went by the name of General Goof. His popularity was evident by the YouTube Play Button plaques on his wall and the rapidly moving chat on one of his monitors, filled with his subscribers, all waiting for him to start tonight’s session. But he had something more important to take care of first.

“Which one should I try next, chat?” Caleb asked before taking another hit, reading the responses through the smoke.

There were 12 soda cans on his desk, all different patterns and colors, though made by the same brand that had sponsored Caleb in exchange for promoting them on his Instagram. He’d drank a sip of one or two for the posts, but besides that, hadn’t touched the others. He figured he couldn’t let all this product go to waste, so he’d try them all.

Caleb squinted. “I’m seeing a lot of green apple…” He announced, eyes catching on the words every few messages. It was hard to tell with so many people at such a speed. “Green apple it is then.”

Caleb grabbed the neon green can off his desk and held the joint between his teeth as he cracked it open. He held the joint aside as he threw his head back and downed a few gulps.

He was trying not to finish off all the sodas. He hated leaving during streams, and drinking so much liquid, a bathroom break would be inevitable. If he could control himself, he figured, then he’d be able to cut down just how many breaks he took, or at best, not have any at all. But sometimes he ended up drinking more than he could handle.

Caleb pulled the can from his mouth with a lazy smile on his face.

“Yo, this one is mad good,” he said as he inspected the can. “I think it might be better than the watermelon.”

Caleb kept an eye on the chat as he went to finish the soda, dirty blond hair falling in his eyes.

9 of the 12 cans on his desk were open. Now, 6 of the 9 were empty. Though, Caleb didn’t spare his predicament any mind as he kept drinking, and after a few more gulps, sat the empty, weightless can on his desk. Not yet realizing he’d sealed his fate in free soda.

A few more hits of his joint and another 2 ½ empty soda cans later, Caleb was ready for the main show. His body was completely relaxed, a permanent little smile on his face, his mind buzzing with the beginnings of his high. He could feel all the soda sloshing around in his stomach as well, but tried to ignore it.

“This is ah…what day is this?” Caleb struggled to remember as he looked at his live stream chat and loaded up the game. “38…nine! 39 of uh Minecraft hardcore mode,” he said. Everyone was saying different numbers, some outrageously lower or higher than what is probably was. But it was fine; he could dig up the previous vods and look through them later to confirm. For now, he was too lazy and sleepy and ready to play.

Caleb played the game and interacted with the chat for around half an hour, making progress towards his goal of 100 days, laughing more as the high fully set in. He received a few donations, kept his viewers entertained in exchange.

The stream was going completely normal until he had to piss.

The urge struck Caleb hard. It was easy to ignore at first; he might’ve been gripping his mouse a little tighter, shifting in his seat to accommodate his filling bladder. But soon it was more than that, became a stinging, urgent pain as his bladder filled and filled and didn’t stop, his skin stretching with the bulging organ, pressing against the waistband of his jeans.

Caleb sucked his teeth in pain as he kept playing, shifting around in his seat, trying to ignore it. But his heart had sped up a beat and he was growing hot, sweating in his hoodie, all telltale signs that this was something he should not ignore. Signs that he desperately needed to go to the bathroom. Caleb swore under his breath when the pain flared up again. His bladder felt too heavy, like it were full of led rather than liquid. And at this rate, he wasn’t sure how much further ignoring it would get him.

He managed for another few minutes, sitting in a way that kept the pressure off his bladder, smiling, interacting with his chat.

But he could only keep it up for so long.

Caleb gulped as he discreetly reached down and popped the button and zipper on his jeans. He sighed in slight relief, the pressure off his bladder at least. But it still hurt. He kept one hand on his keyboard and the other under the desk as he held himself.

He chewed the inside of his cheek, bouncing his leg, grateful as the pain lessened for a moment, but still holding himself as a precaution. Caleb took a deep breath as he kept playing. He could get through this. The stream was only a few hours long; he didn’t need everyone thinking he was some small-bladdered freak by not waiting a little longer.

He could do this.

But Caleb was losing confidence as he repeated the words in his mind, his bladder pains spiking, coming back in full force. He sucked his teeth, closing his legs, tightening his grip on his crotch.

He couldn’t do this.

It felt as though little knives were stabbing him from the inside, the pressure in his bladder so great it made him dizzy, had him squirming in his chair trying not to wet himself.

“Fuck I gotta piss…” Caleb muttered, trying to focus on the game and not the way he felt like he could fill up a swimming pool with his pee. “Damn…”

Caleb held on, his face warming with his efforts to keep it together, the pain ballooning far beyond what he could handle.

His computer chimed with a text-to-speech donation.

“Hand placement is sus,” the robotic female voice read.

Caleb’s eyes snapped up to the monitor, his blush deepening as he read over the chat, messages agreeing with it. Shit.

“Thanks for the five dollars,” Caleb said. “It’s not what you think, guys.” He laughed, and it put pressure on his throbbing bladder.

He tried focusing on the game again, keeping pace so as not to draw any attention to his “suspicious” seating arrangements. But the pain kept him playing slow, had him biting his lip, squirming and shivering. He read over the chat, hoping he was hiding it well enough.

> u good?

> why is he so red

> He got too high

> one handed mc 🗣️

> Is bro acc jerking it?

Caleb gulped, gritting his teeth when his pain spiked. It felt as though the skin around his abdomen was burning to fit his full bladder, the pressure making his brain short circuit for a moment. He whimpered under his breath, nearly whined when white hot pain shot through his cock, the pressure reaching its peak, piss trying to force its way out. The intense feeling only lasted for a moment, but felt like forever as Caleb shook his head, pinching the tip of his dick to keep from ruining his pants. But it was too late.

He was horrified to glance down and find a quarter sized wet spot on his jeans.

It was bad enough he could barely hold it together, but now he’d pissed himself? Caleb gulped, went back to playing the game.

There was another text-to-speech message.

“You look tired,” the robotic female voice read.

Caleb sighed, tightened his grip on himself. “Thanks for the ten. I’m fine just…the sodas are starting to get to me. I’ll go to the bathroom soon but not right now.”

He’d decided then that holding for the rest of the stream wasn’t worth it. He could hide the little stain, but fully wet pants would be a nightmare. He glanced at the chat.

> bathroom reveal

> Piss stream

> im on the toilet rn

> You should go. Don’t wait! We’ll be here when you get back <3

> take us with you

> pooping rn

“I’m fine,” Caleb insisted. “Yeah, I’ll go in like 15 minutes.” He glanced at the time, figured by then his stream would hit the 90 minute mark.

Playing one handed slowed him down significantly and Caleb couldn’t refrain from holding himself, so he discreetly snuck his teddy bear in his chair and stuck it between his legs, using it to help keep himself together.

The method worked fine enough and allowed Caleb to play with two hands, which he did for a while. Until the pain flared up again, had him tightening the grip of his thighs around the bear, gently grinding against it. He was too focused on the game to notice the subtle rocking of his hips, or the way he was slowly growing hard in his pants.

Caleb was casually going about his game when the pain flared up.

He gritted his teeth, dug his hips into the stuffed bear, groaning under his breath when the pleasure of his grinding and pain of his full bladder blended into something addicting, something that his drugged up mind didn’t fully understand was a bad idea to be indulging in on a live stream. But Caleb kept going, kept playing his game, and being desperate to pee, and grinding against the nose of his teddy bear. Because he was, unknowingly, starting to like the feeling, shifting around to get better, more pleasurable angles.

His full bladder pulsed and twitched inside him, and the pressure sent a tingle of arousal through him, left Caleb to whimper as he rocked his hips against his stuffed animal.

It all felt good, too good to even think about stopping for a bathroom break anymore. Which is why Caleb didn’t move when he felt the extra warmth.

His next leak was boiling hot, like molten lava spreading across the crotch of his jeans. Caleb moaned in pain as piss spurted out of him, ground against his teddy bear in an attempt to stop it, but failed horribly, his little stream still spilling out of him, warming him, doing nothing to ease the pain of his bladder.

Caleb sucked his teeth, squirmed until the piss stopped. He pulled back a little to inspect the bear, finding its belly soaked.

“Fuck…” Caleb muttered, putting it back in place, shivering at the warmth pressed up against him. He could and should leave, go to the bathroom right now. He was struggling, wetting himself, should accept that he’d long lost the fight with his bladder. But he wouldn’t, not for a few more minutes. Not when there was progress to be made.

Luckily, no one seemed to have noticed his little accident, so Caleb kept on as he was, acting like he hadn’t leaked twice, acting like the front of his pants weren’t soaked and that he wasn’t hard against the warm, wet fabric right now. While streaming.

But the pain was great, burning, prodding in the worst way. It felt as though there were a sharp, jagged boulder in his abdomen rather than his bladder, and Caleb loathed the pain, how every flare up made him loosen his hold, and leak.

Caleb felt it when it happened again, hot piss escaping into his underwear, leaking into his soaked pants and dampening the teddy bear. Caleb bit his lip, shuffling, reaching down to hold himself to get it to stop, but touching his wet jeans only made it worse. He groaned under his breath, grinding against his teddy bear as his piss drained from his aching bladder. Though he’d never admit it, the brief wetting felt sort of euphoric, had his brain buzzing in a different way than the drugs, even when he finally got it to stop, his bladder no less full.

Caleb looked down, shivering when he noticed the bear was visibly more damp, felt smaller, squishier between his legs. He cursed under his breath, biting back a pained groan when his bladder throbbed in annoyance and dissatisfaction. He needed to go. Now.

He looked at the live chat.

> tf was that

> is bro good???

> stand up

> whyd u stop playing

> nah caleb tweakin

“I’m just…” Caleb blushed when he remembered everyone watching had just seen that, heard his moans and whimpers as he'd leaked. He gulped, embarrassed, hoping no one caught on. “I thought I saw a bug under my desk. Hey uh…quick break, guys. I’ll be back in a minute.”

Caleb hastily minimized the streaming tab and rushed to stand up, the damp teddy bear falling to the floor in the process. Dizziness racked his tired, desperate body for a moment until it subsided and gravity hit, and both hands were on Caleb’s soaked crotch as he waddled out of his bedroom.

He just barely got the door open and was ready to sprint down the hallway when he slipped on the smooth wooden floor and fell on his face. Caleb yelped at the initial hit to the head, groaning when the ache in his face spread, had him shutting his eyes and gritting his teeth. And by the time he remembered his full bladder, it was too late.

Caleb had landed where his lower half was still his his bedroom while everything above the waist was out in the hallway, and he was made all too aware of this when he felt the carpeted floor warming beneath him.

He’d lost control of his bladder during the fall and was currently pissing himself.

Caleb didn’t fight it as he laid there, too high and tired to move. Hot piss quickly rushed out of his full bladder, soaking his jeans down to his legs and dampening the carpet. It was all going to be a pain in the ass to clean up later, but he couldn’t find the energy to care as he moaned, relief coming with the flooding of his pants.

The more he relaxed, the better it felt, piss snaking down his pantlegs, warming him in a way that was so wrong and humiliating it was right. He shivered as he relief overtook him, had him moaning under his breath at the heavenly, overwhelming sensation. The piss kept coming and coming with no end in sight, and Caleb was enjoying every second of it, whimpering in pleasure as his power jet of a stream poured out of him. What he’d felt leaking in the chair was only half of this; this was true euphoria, laying heavy on the ground, soaked in his own piss, raw relief leaving him giddy and satiated at once.

Caleb sighed as his stream slowed, panting as his heart rate settled. His cock twitched as the final drops leaked out, and he shuddered at the weightlessness of his bladder. He didn’t get up immediately, not when he was still trying to process his full bladder fiasco, and wondering why he was hard and had the urge to rub himself through his wet pants even though he was a gross, pissy mess right now, and had just suffered the humiliation of leaking on stream a few minutes prior.

And it would’ve been fine that he turned over on his side to satisfy his curiosity and rub himself into an intense, shaky orgasm right there on the floor.

If his webcam weren’t still on.
