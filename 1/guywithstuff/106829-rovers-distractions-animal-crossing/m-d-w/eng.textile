After a lifetime of love for the kink, I decided to give a crack at writing my own omorashi story. This story features male desperation, wetting, embarrassment, and aftercare. I guess solo male if he's the only one who is desperate? There's some other characters he gets to bounce off of. It's about 4.9k words long. This is my first attempting at writing and publishing my own omo story, so I'd appreciate any comments or critique!

Rover’s Distractions

Rover sat at the city train station casually reading a book and finishing up his breakfast. He was a man who traveled a lot for his line of work, and he preferred to do so by train. Buses were fine but far less comfortable, and planes were a nightmare. He could drive if he really needed to, but it was such a hassle that it was a last resort. In any case, trying to get around the city in a car was a nightmare, and taking a train circumvented a lot of that. The train truly was the perfect intersection of efficiency and comfort, and his line of work afforded him the bells and time needed to make it his primary source of travel.

For breakfast he had a latte, a breakfast sandwich, and a croissant. Fairly standard stuff for a train station cafe, nothing special. He also kept on his person a water bottle to ensure proper hydration and supplements that meal fell short of fulfilling, in addition to his medication. He consumed the various pills with the last long swig of his cooling latte, something he took a strange pride in accomplishing, followed by a drink of water to cleanse his palette.

He wore his typical business-casual attire of a red argyle sweater-vest over a white button-up longsleeve and tan slacks. Red looked good on him, and the outfit was the perfect blend of professional yet approachable.

He glanced at the time on his phone, and then at the screen of bus schedules. It looked like his train would be soon. But not soon enough that he couldn’t take care of one additional need. He packed up his things, got out of his seat, and took a quick stroll over to the restrooms. They were further away from the seats than he would have preferred.

More unfortunately, he noticed that of the two available restrooms, one was cordoned off for cleaning and the other was occupied. He stood for a few minutes, glancing with a bit of concern at the time, the inaccessible toilets, and the stairs leading down to where the trains themselves were. Time. Toilets. Trains. Time. Toilets. Trains.

An announcement went off noting that his train had arrived. Reluctantly, he left the toilets behind to get on the train. As he descended the stairs, he took a very brief glance back and saw the occupied toilet’s door open. It didn’t matter, he told himself, there were toilets on the train.

He boarded the train and found his seat. At the moment, the train was quite packed. It would thin out as the ride progressed and more people got off their stops, but for the moment he mainly had to focus on finding one of his preferred seats.

For just a moment, he considered going back. But it didn’t matter. He had other priorities. He could hold it for a while. And in any case, he had plenty of things to distract himself.

An hour had passed. Rover had found himself consumed within the pages of the book. It was an entry in a series of famous crime thrillers, at least about as famous as a crime thriller could get in this day and age. The cover noted it was a best-seller, but that was the oldest trick in the book in publishing. Order a couple crates of books on a random week of no significance so that it got on a list of bestsellers for that week. Didn’t even have to distribute them if you didn’t feel like it.

Casey awoke from his forced slumber with a sharp gasp. He was in a very small basement, tied to a chair. He noticed a wet sensation on his footpaws. He looked down, and he noticed the basement was flooding with water, ankle deep. He then noticed the source: a tap meant for a washing machine had been let loose and was spraying water without abandon. It had already dampened the cuffs of his pants, much to his displeasure.

“This must be The Family’s doing”, he thought, without an ounce of doubt in his mind. He needed to find a way out of there, and quickly. Before it was too late. He began to squirm against the ropes that bound him in place.

Rover closed the book, forgetting to set his bookmark. The vivid imagery had reminded him of his own needs, particularly as he took a moment to rehydrate. He got up to find a toilet. Then he realized which train he was on.

This particular model was an older one, and its quaint design had the regional transit authority using it for journeys across scenic landscapes to small sleepy towns, like the one he intended to meet his client at. It only had 5 cars: 3 passenger cars, one of which was a caboose, the engine, and a dining car. The dining car was the only one with a toilet. He quickly made his way there. The restroom was occupied, much to his dismay. He patiently waited.

And waited.

And waited.

To alleviate the strain, Rover gripped a nearby railing and crossed one leg over the other, trying to look casual. But to a close observer, his strong grip, his restless tail, and the way his eyes were glued to the door were dead giveaways. He needed to go, and sooner rather than later.

The toilet flushed, louder than he had expected it to. He stiffened in surprise, his tail shooting straight up. The door opened, and its occupant stepped out, a rabbit.

“Hoo-wee!” she said. “Do NOT go in there!”

The rabbit began to explain to Rover the reference to the movie neither one had watched, but Rover entered regardless.

Unfortunately, her one-liner had not been untrue. The state of the restroom was about as abysmal as it could get without a deliberate attempt to trash it. His face sank as he looked at it. The seat was disgusting, the paper roll was more of a suggestion, and the sink was clogged with something he did not care to identify. It felt like a betrayal of the comfort and coziness of the rest of the locomotive. This was a nightmare toilet. Its aura was downright threatening. There was no way he could use it.

He exited as quickly as he entered. The rabbit was treating herself to a sandwich. How she was able to tolerate such conditions was beyond his understanding. Rover tensed up for a moment before taking a deep breath and returning to his seat. He would just have to wait until he got to his destination.

Another hour had passed. Rover sat in his seat, one leg tightly crossed over the other and his right handpaw gripping onto the armrest. His claws, normally retracted, were out, and the footpaw on the floor of the train and right handpaw were starting to dig into the quaint seating.

His left handpaw held his phone displaying the train schedule. He would arrive at his destination in another two hours. He tried to look at the situation from a glass half-full perspective, or perhaps a bladder half-empty one. He was already at the midpoint of this journey, and as soon as he got to the station he could use the restroom there to get his much-needed relief.

He had tried to distract himself by admiring the scenery, but eventually decided it wasn’t going to be enough for him as the weather turned from sunny to cloudy to rainy. He could hear the raindrops patter against the windows. He had been expecting rain and had packed supplies for when he departed, including a very fashionable raincoat (neatly folded) and a stylish umbrella. Normally this would be quite relaxing for him. His childhood was one in a very rainy region and muted skies and earthy scents were calming for him. Not today. Not when he needed to pee this badly.

He decided to try reading again but it was taking him a moment to find his place. Despite his damp circumstances, Casey’s inevitable escape and resumption of his investigation would provide Rover the distraction he needed.

The situation was not ideal, but Casey began looking for advantages. The faucet had gotten a headstart on him, but the method of execution was poorly thought-out, even if this building was The Family’s property and could be easily covered up. It would take at least another hour before the water levels could get high enough to actually drown him.

The basement was functionally a gray concrete hole, but there was a single small window that would lead out into the city streets. This was probably the safer means of escape, on the off chance that the first floor had anyone to watch the stairs or deal with the inevitable cleanup. It would be a tight fit, but he could manage it.

The ropes bound tightly around his torso, but only his torso. His legs were free, although getting to a standing position would be extremely difficult.

The chair. Of course! The chair! It was old and inexpensive, and creaked as he sat on it. If he could break the chair somehow it might provide the bit of slack he needed to slip out of the ropes, much like he planned to do with the window. But how? Weight and force, perhaps. If he deliberately tipped himself over, he could cause the chair to fall apart.

With as much effort as he could muster, he began rocking himself back and forth.

Rover too found himself rocking back and forth as he turned to the next page. Before he continued though, he realized the train had come to a stop. They were at a station. To his dismay however, it was not his destination. A frog boarded and sat across from him.

“Is it okay if I sit here?” she asked, having already taken her seat.

“Oh! I don’t mind at all. In fact, I was getting a bit lonely.” said Rover. He closed his book, remembering to place his bookmark this time. While he did not wish to show himself squirming in front of another, conversation was a great opportunity for distraction.

“Why don’t you tell me about yourself? I travel around a lot and it’s wonderful to learn about different people.”

She introduced herself. Her name was Lily, and coincidetnally she had the same destination as him to meet a romantic partner of hers. They spoke of hobbies, partners, vocations. Rover spoke of his own romantic partners, who also lived great distances away from each other, and how he would visit them on trips that took him to their regions. There was Blanca, who had similar eccentricities to him and also traveled for a living, and there was Rudy, who lived a more quiet life in a small town. There was also Tom, but between their more professional relationship and Tom’s past relationships with professionals, he did not wish to pursue any sort of relationship with Rover. Lily seemed confused by that part but took it in stride. He had a place of residence, but it was small and inexpensive as he traveled around so much that he rarely spent more than a few weeks there at any given time. His laptop was his filing cabinet, and the cafes of the world were his offices.

As they chatted, Lily decided to pop what she felt was a worthwhile question.

“Hey are you okay? You seem pretty antsy.”

It was true. He was distracting his mind, but his body had other priorities. His face looked strained, his crossed legs had become far less subtle, with one handpaw placed between them and the other gripping onto the seat for dear life, tearing at the upholstery. His footpaws were tightly curled, and his tail was in all sorts of zigzags and flickers.

And that’s when his mind caught up and his subconscious thoughts came to surface.

Bathroombathroombathroombathroombathroombathroombathroombathroom I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM! Holditholditholditholditholditholditholditholditholditholdit I HAVE TO HOLD IT

“I- uh- I- I’m fine! Don’t worry about it!“ He said anxiously. But any subtlety in his need had long been abandoned. If he was squirming before, then he was struggling at this point.

“No you’re not. ” said Lily, crossing her arms. “You’re squirming. Do you need to go to the bathroom?”

“Uh- um- I guess so!” Rover said, squirming. Gottapeegottapeegottapeegottapeegottapee “I hadn’t noticed. Well, I can wait until we get to the stop. It’s fine. I’m fine. I can hold it.” YOU MUST HOLD IT!!!

Rover uncrossed and recrossed his legs, now with both hands grabbing onto his crotch. He shook nervously.

“This isn’t a city bus, why don’t you go on the train bathroom?” Asked Lily

“You don’t want to go in there. It’s in no state for usage. I guess they make Out Of Order signs for a reason right?” He chuckled nervously. Far more nervously than he anticipated.

“How long until the stop?” he asked in a quiet tone, his pupils narrowing.

“Like an hour?” said Lily, glancing at a copy of the schedule she picked up at the station. “You can last an hour, right?”

And then came The Bumps.

The train was passing through rocky terrain, along cliffs and through tunnels. While not so poorly maintained as to cause a derailment, the ride got significantly more bumpy. With each bump, additional pressure was put on his bladder.

Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun

He shook with each bump. No longer able to hide his desperation, his squirming became more and more frantic, occasionally changing poses, just for the sake of squirming.

Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun

The legs recrossed.

Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun

The ankles joined them.

Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun

His tail curled tightly around one leg.

Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun

His grip tightened.

Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun

He was lying across the seat.

Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun KA-TUN

This particularly powerful bump knocked Rover off the seat. He did not get up out of fear of losing control and he rolled around squeezing his crotch and with his legs double-crossed, momentarily tightening it with each bump. He started moaning in agony.

Lily was obviously concerned. It was good he gave up trying to pretend otherwise, but this strange but kind man was definitely not going to make it at this rate. She looked through her own bags for something to help. No dice. Well, besides the pouch of them she used for tabletop games with her girlfriend. With a lack of options, she vied for moral support.

“Look, dude. You’re going to be fine. Well, unless you get a bladder infection. Maybe peeing your pants would be better in that case.”

“You’re not helping.” Rover meekly whispered.

“Do you have anything in your bags? Like a water bottle or something?”

“That hydroflask-Hng!-is a premium model and-Gnh!-costs 12,000 bells. I am NOT dirtying it!”

“Okay, jeez. Um. Maybe we could try distracting you again?”

“S-sure. Tell me about yourself. Surely you’ve got something-NNG!–you’d like to talk about?”

Lily looked through her bags and noticed the laminated character sheet she was planning on bringing for tabletop night. Her eyes lit up.

“Oh! How about I tell you about my Colony Drop character?”

“Uh, sure. What’s that?”

Rover spent the next hour squirming on the floor of a train desperately trying not to piss himself while a very strange but kind woman taught him about Serrated Edge, a battle medic from a sci-fi military tabletop game called Colony Drop. He learned there were other tabletop roleplaying games besides Travelers and Treasures, and also that some of them were way less rules heavy than the handful of T&T sessions that he got invited to in college before drama broke out and everyone stopped talking to each other.

He learned about Serrated Edge’s troubled (I need to pee) childhood that led her to finding her calling as a soldier of fortune, more specifically (Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun) the one that tended to her unit’s wounds after difficult missions. How she lost her nursing license for a crime she (squirm, squirm) didn’t commit. How intimate her relationship with the battle engineer (played by her partner) Iron Gear (Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun) was, which seemed to be a strange sort of love built around an intense sense of (Don’t Pee Yourself) rivalry. Then he learned Iron Gear’s backstory (Hold It Hold It Hold It) and her emotional hangups and what brought her call to arms about and so on and so forth for the (Ka-tun ka-tun, ka-tun ka-tun) remaining members. Then he started to lose the plot a little as she went on about the campaign itself.

With great strain to keep his mind on anything that didn’t involve his intense need to use a toilet, he occasionally meekly asked questions to learn more details. The setting seemed to be one of intense (CLENCH) conflict, where no side was truly “good” except for handfuls of the people on the ground who were trying whatever they (I CAN HOLD IT) could to be more than simply a cog in a machine. There seemed (HOLD IT) to be some deeper themes at play regarding the conflicts of generations (I NEED TO PEE) past and the unspoken ones of times present, but at a certain point he got a little lost about it (YOU NEED TO HOLD IT), especially between the filters of Lily’s commentary and what might have happened in her game versus the official (HOLD IT HOLD IT HOLD IT) source material she was working with.

Overall, it went swimmingly. Especially about half an hour in when the train was on more stable terrain and only bumped a normal amount.

Eventually the train pulled into the station they needed to get to. The PA spoke as such. Rover, who at this point was crumpled into a ball trying his best not to soak his slacks, shot straight up. The doors opened up and they exited onto the small train station. Rover’s suitcase was gripped in one handpaw while the other remained firmly on his crotch. The strain on his bladder was intense, overwhelming, and about to end very soon, one way or another. He had forgotten about the rain during all of what happened and had not bothered to put on his raincoat. There was a much more pressing need.

As raindrops splashed onto his fur and clothing, his eyes darted around for the restroom. There was only one, a single stall, across the way from the platform where they stood.

And it was unoccupied.

Rover felt an intense sense of hope and anticipation. He made his way over, desperate for relief. Finally, finally he would get to pee after spending hours in agonizing desperation.

And just before he got to it, another person entered and locked the door behind them.

The moment of hope was replaced with panic. He was so close. So maddeningly close. His bladder was screaming for release. He began rapidly hopping from foot to foot, slamming his fist on the door, begging to be let in.

“PLEASE! It’s an emergency! I’ve been waiting all day for this!”

The occupant shouted something at him. He couldn't quite make it out, but the intonation and the hostility made it clear they didn’t care about how badly he needed to go.

Rover put the last of his willpower in trying to hold it for just a little bit longer, just a few more minutes. Seconds, even. Just long enough to use the toilet. The struggle and desperation were so intense it could have just as easily been an eternity as it could have been an instant.

And then the toilet flushed. And Rover lost control.

The sound reverberated through his skull. The sound that he so very strongly associated with the long-awaited relief he needed. His dam burst, as a torrent of urine gushed out of his bladder, through his urethra, by way of his genitals. It dampened his underwear and slacks with rapid force, splashing and soaking against them, eventually clinging onto either his fur or his slacks, descending in rivulets and growing into an enormous puddle. So much volume and pressure erupted from him that some of it even stained his topwear, forcing its way onto his shirt and sweater-vest.

Despite this, he wasn't particularly unhappy about this. While there was an intense sense of shame and embarrassment, it was buried under the surprise of finally letting go. He was frozen in place, tail vertical and his eyes glued to the rapidly growing wet patch. Soon, the surprise wore off and gave way to relief. His muscles slackened and his stiffened surprise gave way to the intense comfort of finally letting it all out. He had an expression that could loosely be described as a smile, but was much too slack in nature compared to the more polite or professional smiles he would typically give. He let out a loud and powerful moan of relief.

Lily, who had followed Rover out of concern, was surprised by the shock of watching an adult man wet himself out of sheer desperation, but completely unsurprised that Rover’s needs would result in this. Surely the restroom in the dining car couldn’t have been that bad. None of this would have happened if he sucked it up and just pissed in a gross toilet.

But while she had anticipated the inevitable, she wasn’t heartless about its arrival. As Rover’s relief tapered off with the last few drops of urine and gave way to the deep shame and embarrassment, she offered him some form of comfort.

“Hey, it’s okay dude. Don’t worry about it. Better out than in, right? You know, like the movie?”

Rover awkwardly nodded, looking down at his soaked pants and blushing profusely. He had seen that movie, but it wasn’t really the sort of thing he needed on his mind at the moment. He wrapped his arms around his torso, feeling as bound by fate as Casey had been bound by ropes. He was too embarrassed about the whole thing to vocalize his feelings any further.

And boy were they soaked. While he did drink a bit of water to keep hydrated, there had been far more piss in his bladder than he had anticipated. All but the outermost parts of the pants were drenched. His underwear felt like it was totally compromised. Not even the button-up was spared.

“Hey, why don’t you crash at my girlfriend’s place while you’re here? Or at least until we can wash your clothes?”

Thankfully, while his outfit was a fairly high quality (although now significantly depreciated in value by the saturation of urine) they weren’t dry-clean only.

Silver linings, he thought to himself. He looked up at the clouds. The rain was slowing to a stop, and the overcast was once again a calming sight.

“I’d like that. Thanks.”

He walked out of the enormous puddle and opened his suitcase. He unfolded the raincoat and donned it. It was a very nice quality and a pleasant shade of burgundy. It was a long coat, going down to his ankles, making it great for hiding his wet clothing. It also included a very useful hood, which he pulled over his head in order to hide his face.

The two walked out of the train station, having forged a very strange and circumstantial bond of friendship.

The occupant exited the restroom and awkwardly skirted around the massive puddle.

The two soon arrived at the home of Lily’s partner, Petri. Lily knocked on the door and announced her presence. Petri happily opened the door and gave her girlfriend a hug and a kiss. She was a mouse dressed in a labcoat and wore stylized glasses. She then noticed the mysterious hooded figure glowering next to her.

“H-hey! Who the hell is that? Tom???”

“No, this is Rover. We met on the train.”

He lowered his hood. He was initially a little confused, but then realized there’s obviously going to be more than two people in the world named Tom.

“He peed his pants on the way here!”

Rover’s embarrassment had been slowly receding, but that comment brought it back. He quickly pulled his hood back up and looked away from Petri.

“Oh. Cool!” responded Petri, her gaze lowering to Rover’s crotch. Unfortunately for her, the raincoat was opaque. Unfortunately for Rover, it didn’t make him any less embarrassed.

“Well? Come on in!” said Petri, pulling her girlfriend in. Rover followed.

The home looked to be equal parts laboratory, housing, and some sort of half-remembered dream of what he imagined the future would look like as a child. As he observed the bizarre surroundings, he noticed a few diplomas on the walls. This broke his awkward silence, surprising him in a whole new way. He turned to face, pointing dramatically.

“Wait a minute! You’re Dr. Petri! The bionics researcher! You’re my client!”

“Oh!” said Dr. Petri. “Well, I guess I am. You wanted to work out those supply details?”

“Yes, of course.” said Rover, quickly nodding. “Do you want to get started on that?”

“I think we’ve got other problems to deal with first, piss boy.” She gave a smug smile along with the moniker. Rover felt this was very unprofessional, but so was coming to your client’s home with their significant other and soaked shorts. He’d have to deal with this situation as it came to him.

“Um, of course, ma’am.” said Rover, blushing and breaking his gaze.

“You don’t need to ma’am me. It makes me feel like I’m your mom or something. Now let’s get you some clean shorts.”

After a very thorough shower, Rover was given a change of clothes. Speaking with his client in only a towel would normally have been extremely unconventional for him, but at this point he was past the point of needing to care. Through some bizarre circumstance, he had broken everything that he considered professional behavior, but Petri seemed to be very charmed by the occurrence and seemed much more amicable to working with him than he had expected, perhaps even more so had he arrived under what he considered ideal circumstances.

He donned the garments, but wasn’t quite expecting what he got. A t-shirt depicting a crossover between the stars of two decade-old sci-fi shows and a pair of snug boxer briefs that read “I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE! ⚛ 🧪” on the ass and depicted another illustration of an atom on the crotch.

“You can keep them, by the way. I’ve outgrown them both physically and culturally.”

“Thank you.” said Rover, still processing the situation. He had changes of clothes, of course, but his client seemed quite amicable, so he chose not to decline the strange gift for the sake of his actual job.

Lily held back a laugh at seeing Rover in her girlfriend’s old undergarments, thinking back to when she teased her for them all those years ago.

Over the following week, Rover and Petri worked out the details of the supply deal, and he became close friends with her and Lily along with the rest of their group, who had all come to visit for an annual in-person meetup. Tom, as it turned out, was not a moderately successful owner of a convenience store chain, but rather a blue cat with a distinct gaze and a career as a professional boxer. They were very different people, but he could see the resemblance Petri made, especially since Tom’s character, an enigmatic battle mage, was always dressed in an ominous hooded red raincoat.

The group enjoyed his presence, had a hell of a time clearing up the details on Lily’s story of their unit, and they even invited him to join their next campaign. A strange trip with strange people under strange circumstances, but by the end of the week he wouldn’t have had it any other way.

Eventually, he made the return trip to the city, this time having gotten the chance to empty his bladder before boarding. He popped open the crime thriller, the bookmark he had left still in it’s place. His time with Lily, Tom, and Petri left him with surprisingly little time to do his reading. He resumed where he had left off.

After a solid few minutes of struggling, Casey managed to tip back the chair, bracing for impact. The wood shattered beneath him, and he would undoubtedly need to be examined for splinters.

Hastily, he wiggled his way out of the ropes, a task easier said than done even with the additional slack. By the time he finally broke out of his bindings, the water level had risen past “treading” to “floating”.

Casey forced open the small window and using the adrenaline that came with escaping a death trap, lifted himself up and pulled himself out.

He emerged on a street corner in front of an abandoned mill building. He knew where he was. The rusted district, once home to the fires of industry, now lay littered with vacant, burnt, or collapsed old industrial buildings, after the men who owned them decided it would be easier to exploit workers further away from their manors and less likely to solve workplace issues with force.

Casey ran. He needed to get back to the safehouse, where his medic buddy could treat him and he could dispose of his waterlogged outfit. But for the moment, he took solace in knowing he was free. Soaking wet, but free.

Soaking wet but free, Rover thought to himself. Corny, but vivid.

THE END
