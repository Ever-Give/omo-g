I don't usually post, but I had an enticing fantasy in the shower and decided to put it into some words. Just my mind making up whatever is the hottest. Have the paragraph:

There is one thing that could permanently dissuade me from living alone...

And that's me, taking my time shaving in the shower. My roommate comes home in a hurry to rapidly knock on the bathroom door. She's busting! I somewhat hastily, somewhat conflicted, get out of the shower a bit quicker than usual. I can hear her tapping feet on the ground from her bouncing. As I unlock the door, she yanks it open trying to force her way in, only to run into me, first knocking me over, then tripping and falling onto me. A dark patch is growing on her shorts, right in the middle between her legs. it starts dripping down on me. She can't find the strength to pull herself up, her pee keeps coming out. It's running all over my belly, chest and between my legs. Guess I'm gonna have to shower again?
