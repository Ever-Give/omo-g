Chapter 1: The Third Date

Evan had been in the shower long enough that the water had turned cold. It was mostly a testament to how shitty the water heater in the building was, more than to how long of a shower he had taken, even though he had spent longer in there than usual—soaping up from head to toe, cutting his toenails and grooming a bit below-the-belt. There was still shampoo in his hair, but thanks to his short hairstyle a quick rinse was enough to get it out.

Stepping out of the shower, he noticed an unread message on his phone. He read it and smiled to himself—it was his date letting him know that she had to stay a while longer at work, but that Evan could come by her place at the time they'd agreed on anyway, promising him a cold beer to drink while he waited for her to get ready. Evan had been talking to Sydney for close to a month, and tonight would be their third date. He knew third dates didn't automatically mean something would happen, but he still hoped it would, who could blame him? Sydney was smoking hot, and even though the age difference—her 37 to his 28—had given him pause when they first started talking, he had barely thought about it after getting to know her better.

So, after Evan had dried off, and with high expectations about how the evening might end, he chose his outfit with a bit more care than usual. He started with a pair of plain white boxers, and on top of that, he pulled on a pair of dark blue chinos and a light blue shirt which he paired with a pullover in a warm brown color that he'd been told brought out the hazel in his eyes. To finish the look, he laced up a pair of white sneakers.

Checking the time and seeing that he only had a couple minutes until he needed to be out the door he made one last trip to the bathroom—as was his habit before leaving his apartment—and while he finished up he went back and forth in his mind about whether he should wear one of the “absorbent shields” that he usually wore when leaving the house. On one hand, he didn't want to have to excuse himself to go to the bathroom to remove it if things turned heated at the end of the evening, but on the other hand, he really didn't want to risk any leakage showing through his pants.

It’s not that he expected he could keep his issue a secret if they kept seeing each other, but it wasn't a conversation he was looking forward to having. He'd learned to live with it and accept his incontinence as something he could manage but most likely never get rid of, but it had taken him most of his life to get to that point, so stand to reason that it'd be hard for anyone else to accept it as well. That was his experience in previous relationships at least, which more often than not had sizzled out after the talk.

Sydney seemed different though. Maybe it was just wishful thinking, he had only known for a month after all. Just because she was older than him didn't mean that she'd react to the news more maturely than any other woman he'd dated, but he’d deal with that problem later.

After a few more seconds of deliberation, he reached into the cupboard beneath the sink, bringing out a pad, and affixing it to his underwear. They were going to a restaurant, so he figured he could just remove it in the bathroom before they left.

.

When Evan got there, Sydney was by her front door, looking through her purse.

“Oh, hi! I just need to find my keys and I'll get you that beer I promised,” Sydney said, shooting Evan a wink.

He didn’t mind waiting for her seeing as he hadn't had much opportunity to sit down and just breathe today—having come directly home from work himself, and straight into the shower.

“I won't say no to a beer, but don't feel like you have to rush.”

Sydney got the door open and turned to him with a smile. “Someone taught you well,” she said, entering the large hallway of her house, kicking off her shoes.

Evan laughed. “Growing up with three sisters hasn't left me much of a choice. The last time I complained about things taking too long I almost got my eye taken out by an eyeshadow palette.”

“And here I thought growing up with brothers was rough,” she said, giving a low whistle. “Anyway, it shouldn't take me too long to get ready, I just need a change of clothes and to freshen up my makeup. But let's get you that beer.”

She walked into the room next to the hallway—an open-plan kitchen and living room—and made her way to the fridge.

“Let's see. I've got Heineken, Stella aaand a couple of bottles of my brother's newest midlife crisis project—drink at your peril,” she said, turning to him with a joking glint in her eye.

“Haven't had a Stella in forever.”

“Good choice,” she said, twisting off the cap and handing him the beer. “You look great by the way, I love that sweater on you,” she complimented, letting her hand brush against his arm. “I'll go get ready as well—feel free to put on some music or snoop around if you get bored.”

She disappeared into what Evan assumed was her bedroom, and he spent the next thirty or so minutes emptying his beer and looking around the house. He wouldn't describe her house as cluttered, but she had a lot of stuff to browse through. There were pictures of her with friends and family, bookshelves full of books and random little trinkets, and an impressive—although dated—collection of music CDs.

He was looking through the CDs when she got back from the bedroom, wearing a long skirt with a matching top.

“Wow,” he said, trying not to fumble with the CD case he was holding. “You look amazing.”

“Thank you,” she said, tucking her hair behind her ear. “Had to step up my game. You set the bar pretty high.”

It had been a while since Evan dated someone who complimented his looks as readily as Sydney did. Most of the women his age seemed reluctant to—maybe in an effort to play hard to get, he didn't know. He liked this better though.

“Thanks,” he said, holding out his arm. “Ready to leave?”

She grabbed his arm, the bracelet around her wrist jingling softly. “Yes, let's go.”

.

He felt it the moment he sat down in the passenger seat—the familiar aching pressure in his bladder. The restaurant was a 15-minute drive away, at most. That's nothing, he should be able to hold it for 15 minutes, come on.

Still, he looked back at Sydney's house. Relief a simple ‘sorry, just need to take a quick leak’ away. But … it would have been weird, right? 15 measly minutes to the restaurant—even if someone was bursting they'd be able to hold it for 15 minutes. Someone other than Evan, at least. But, he didn't even have to go that bad. No, it's okay, he could hold it. He had to.

Roughly five minutes later, Evan wished he could go back in time, punch himself, and just use the damn bathroom like he knew he should have. He hadn't been careless enough to put himself in this kind of situation in months, maybe a year even—normally in tune with his body enough to know his limits—and he felt a sense of panic mounting with each urgent twinge from his bladder.

The only comfort he could hang onto was that he'd had the foresight to put on a pad. That would save his pants when he inevitably lost a few spurts. He just hoped that it would happen the way it usually did, in front of the toilet, where he could get his hand down his pants and clamp down until he had the chance to position himself, getting most of it in the toilet.

He barely even considered the latchkey leakage part of his issues anymore, it was just how things went for him, and with the pads he didn't have to cope with an annoying wet spot in his underwear or having to keep extras with him to change, paranoid about smelling like stale urine as the day went on. He knew he'd gone a bit nose blind to the smell himself, so he took extra care when he was around people.

At home he was lazy about it from time to time, not wanting to use up more of the pads than necessary, his sweatpants ending up with wet spots that he ignored until they dried again. Yes, it was kind of gross, but … he liked being gross sometimes.

Not right now, though. The last thing he wanted was Sydney to find out by getting it shoved in her face—not literally—before he'd had a chance to tell her in a more dignified setting.

But he doubted he'd be lucky enough to get out of this situation without an incident leading to him having to awkwardly explain himself to Sydney. He just hoped it would be because he'd had to run inside the restaurant the moment the car stopped, instead of … no, he didn't even want to think about worse scenarios—something that was easier said than done when his bladder kept firing signals of impending doom, making his heart thunder away in his chest, sweat breaking out on his forehead.

The aching pressure he'd felt at the start of the ride had begun to morph into something else. A stinging sensitivity at the tip of his dick made him wish he could get his hand down there, fight pressure with pressure and ease the discomfort for just a few seconds. He couldn't do that, of course, but he also couldn't keep himself from readjusting the way he was seated—struggling to find a balance between outright squirming in his seat, and finding a position that would give him an ounce of relief.

Sydney didn't seem to notice—thank god—as she was too busy keeping track of traffic. The two of them were far from the only people planning a dinner out tonight, and it struck Evan that the expected 15-minute ride would probably end up closer to 20 minutes. Shit. In a stroke of luck, he found a way to sit that eased the pressure on his bladder considerably and he spent the next 10 minutes practically frozen in that position, praying to whatever cosmic entity out there that he’d make it, trying to ignore the dull ache slowly returning.

Just a couple more minutes till the restaurant. A couple more minutes till the bathroom, he kept repeating in his mind like a mantra as they reached the last stoplight before their destination—he could even see the lights from the restaurant, and—oh no.

He crossed his legs, a gasp involuntarily escaping him, earning a glance from Sydney, as a wave of urgency that made a cold chill running down the back of his neck overtook him. His bladder started spasming painfully, the last of his control slipping.

It started slow, white-hot heat seeping out of him, but he didn't have any delusions that he'd be able to keep it that way long enough to get to the bathroom before the pad reached capacity. It wasn't made to hold much, and definitely not made to soak up liquid coming as fast as it did when your muscles gave up—something that was imminent, judging by the cramping flutters increasing in strength.

The car came to a stop, and the only thing Evan could hope for was getting out of the car fast enough to avoid destroying the seat. He glanced down, the bulging of the pad glaringly obvious to him, but his pants were still dry as he unbuckled his seat belt and scrambled to get out of the car.

He slammed the door shut, leaning against the side of the car, unsure of if his legs would hold him as urine started pouring out of him fast enough that it came through the fabric of his pants, liquid spattering down onto the concrete, rapidly forming a puddle.

He barely heard Sydney shutting the door on her side of the car over his panicked breathing, mind going a mile a minute trying to figure out a way to stop her from walking over to him—obviously wondering why he stopped right outside of the car—but coming up short, aside from a weak, “Wait, don't … ” as Sydney rounded the front of the car.

“What are you—Oh,” she said, stopping dead in her tracks in front of him, a surprised expression on her face. Evan looked away before it turned into a look of disgust, trying to spare himself the humiliation.

His face was burning, the stinging heat of embarrassment crawling up the back of his neck, every instinct screaming at him to get out of there—leg it, get back to his apartment, delete and block her number, and try to forget it ever happened—but his legs wouldn't move. He was frozen in place, awaiting her reaction.

At least the puddle at his feet had stopped expanding, but the slant of the ground had the pee running in a slow rivulet alongside the car, toward where Sydney was standing—as if she needed further evidence of what had happened.

She stepped to the side, her high heels scraping against the asphalt, echoing loudly in the awkward silence. A pained noise escaped Evan despite himself, snapping Sydney out of her silent contemplation about the situation, and before he knew it she was in front of him, hand stretched out in a tentative gesture.

“Hey, no, don't be embarrassed, it's okay,” she said, her hand coming to rest on his arm. She looked around the parking lot, toward the restaurant, before trying to meet his eyes. “It’s okay, there's no one around, no one saw you.”

You saw, he thought, but brought himself to meet her gaze. There was no look of disgust on her face, no condescending glare, just concern and maybe a bit of confusion, which was fair. He owed her an explanation.

He grimaced. “Shit, I'm sorry, I … “ Yeah, what? Thought he could hold it? Thought that he could drink a beer and hold it for 20 minutes? No, of course not, not him, not with his stupid fucking bladder, God—

The hand on his arm gave a comforting squeeze, pulling him out of his self-deprecating spiral. “Don't worry about it, just …” She looked around the parking lot again, thinking. “You know what, let's get back in the car, yeah? Just let me—” She opened the back door, leaning in and pulling out an empty grocery bag from the pocket on the backseat before giving him an apologetic smile. “Sorry, the seat,” she said before nudging past him and placing the bag onto the passenger seat.

Evan took a deep breath, wincing at the growing coldness of wet fabric, and prepared himself for a very awkward drive back.

Chapter 2: The Drive Back

They sat in silence for a while, Evan looking out the passenger window and Sydney navigating her way out of the heavy traffic of the city center. When they reached the highway he could feel Sydney glancing at him, taking in breaths as if she was about to say something, but then changing her mind at the last second.

He couldn’t blame her. What was there to say? What could he say to save this? ‘Sorry, I know this isn't how you imagined this date going, but if you could drop me off at home I'll just have a quick shower and change and I promise I'll hold it like a big boy the rest of the evening.’ Oh God, he's fucked. And he'd really been looking forward to this date as well. Felt like it might lead somewhere real.

Next to him, Sydney took in another breath and gently cleared her voice before speaking. “I, uh, completely understand if you just want me to drive you home and I'll probably never hear from you again, but … I mean, can I be honest with you?”

Evan nodded, mentally preparing himself to get rejected. He didn't think she'd be mean about it—she was too kind of a person for that—but it would still sting.

“This,” she said, gesturing vaguely towards Evan's pants, his cheeks flushing red, “doesn't even get this date into the top five worst dates I've had since the divorce, not even close, and … I like you, okay? Maybe I haven't been all too clear about that, but I've been having so much fun with you, and you're kind and smart and good-looking, and I've been looking forward to this date all week, smiling to myself like an idiot at work thinking about it, about you, and … sorry, I'm rambling, aren't I? Just … could we maybe not call it a night?”

It took a while for Evan to grasp what she'd just said, so at odds to what he'd expected. “Uh, sorry, what?”

“You can get cleaned up and change first, of course, and if you'd rather stay in tonight, order take-out, watch a movie or something, we can do that. It's up to you but I just want you to know that I'm not judging you or thinking any less of you for—” She nodded toward Evan's pants, but this time it was her cheeks that turned red. “You can tell me no if it's weird. I don't know.”

Realizing that it wasn’t his wet pants that were about to fuck up the date, but his inability to believe that someone could treat him nicely after an accident Evan sputtered out, “No! No, it's not weird. Movie and take-out sounds nice, I'd like that. Um, after a shower and … yeah,” he said, grocery bag crinkling beneath him as he tried to find a position that made as little of the wet fabric cling to him as possible. It had started to itch.

Sydney seemed to notice. “Are you very uncomfortable?”

“A bit, but mostly just so fucking embarrassed.”

“Don't be, I mean it. It's no big deal, but, um, if you want to get out of the wet clothes as quickly as possible, it'd probably be faster if we stopped by Target and picked something up instead of driving back to your place. You're at the other end of town right?”

“Yeah.”

“And don't worry, you can wait in the car while I'll get you something to wear, and then you can shower at my place.”

The thought of Sydney going into the store, browsing the clothing aisle for a pair of pants, underwear and, yeah, he definitely needed dry socks as well, had shame curling hot inside of him. But she was right, it would be a lot faster than driving back to his place, plus, his apartment was a mess—he'd been meaning to get to it, okay—and he didn’t want her to think he was a slob.

So, he nodded, swallowing whatever modicum of pride he had left, and agreed to Sydney's suggestion.

A bit of an interlude chapter, but I already had it written. The final chapter(s) will most likely be up in the coming week or two.

Chapter 3: Second Chance

It didn’t take long before they were back at Sydney’s place, and with his hand clenching the Target bag containing the pair of chinos—much like the ones he was wearing, just a different color—socks, and underwear that Sydney had bought him, Evan walked down the hallway to where the guest bathroom was located.

He stripped out of his wet clothes, shoving them into the bag and tying it hard enough that the plastic almost ripped. Although Sydney had acted in the best way he could have hoped, he still felt humiliated. Angry at himself for risking it tonight of all nights. Angry at his body for not cutting him some slack just this once.

The water pressure in the shower, paired with the luxurious mousse body wash—he didn't even know body wash came in mousse form—got him feeling slightly better, and when the chinos Sydney had gotten him turned out to fit perfectly he almost felt back to his old self, prepared to face Sydney again, and explain himself.

He found her in the living room, skirt swapped for a pair of lounge pants, browsing Netflix.

She turned around, face lighting up. “Oh, good, they fit!” she said, referring to the chinos. “The rest fit okay as well?”

“Yes, thank you, I-I know this wasn't what you expected tonight. I'm sor—”

“Stop it,” she said. “You didn't do it on purpose, I assume?” He shaked his head. “Then there's no need to apologize. Come sit down—you can pick the movie, I already ordered food.”

Evan did as she said, taking a seat next to her, bundling up with a thick blanket she pushed toward him. He didn't even think to ask what food she had ordered, somehow already knowing that it'd be something he'd like.

.

The food arrived, and the movie Evan had chosen played in the background while they ate and talked. Sydney had gotten more beer for Evan—that he drank slowly, not wanting to get caught off guard again—and white wine for herself that she was just pouring herself another glass of, taking a sip before turning toward Evan with a thoughtful look on her face. “Can I … ask you some questions?”

“Sure, go ahead.”

“Tonight wasn't the first time that happened to you, was it?”

Straight to the point, okay. “Uh, no, it wasn't.”

“I assume you've been to the doctor,” she said, Evan nodding his answer. “So, um, I guess I'm just wondering—”

“What's wrong with me?”

“Hey, I wasn't gonna phrase it like that,” she said, playfully smacking him on the arm.

Evan snickered, starting to get a bit tipsy from the beer. “I know. But that's what you're asking?” She nodded, taking another sip of wine. “Well … I wish I had an easy answer for you, but I don't. I have, like, a guy—a urologist—that I've gone to since I was a teen, and the closest to an explanation he’s got is that it's a nerve issue, possibly something connected to the spine, but nothing that they've been able to pinpoint.”

She nodded, listening intently as he continued.

“There's nothing they can do about it—nothing that helps more than it hurts at least, so I just try and manage it,” he said, feeling his cheeks warm, thinking back on the evening, how “well-managed” that had been. “Tonight was—I'm sorry about that, I'm usually better at, uh, not …” he trailed off, staring at the bottle in his hand.

“So tonight was … out of the ordinary?”

Of course she wanted to know that, and of course Evan wished he could say that ‘yeah, no, tonight was a once in a blue moon event, total freak accident’ but if he'd gotten this far telling the truth he didn't see a reason to start skirting around it now.

“Uh … I mean it's—it's not an everyday thing … or, not like what happened tonight. It is an everyday thing, but like, less than … that.” He didn't think he'd ever stared at a bottle as closely as he did then, following a drop of condensation making a trail down the bottleneck—the sight of liquid making him realize he should excuse himself to the bathroom soon.

Sydney moved her hand to rest on top of his. “We can change the subject if you'd rather not talk about it.”

“No, it's okay. I'm just—I've gotten some bad reactions is all,” he said, Sydney furrowing her brows in concern. “But it's fine, I'm used to it. And it's better to just … get it all out in the open so you can decide that it's a deal breaker sooner rather than later.”

“It’s not a deal breaker,” she said sincerely. “Everyday thing or not.”

He believed her. Even though there were details he hadn't told her yet—details that had been the nail in the coffin in previous relationships—he had a feeling those wouldn't phase her any more than everything that had already transpired. And she still seemed interested, having moved closer to him on the couch as they've been talking, her thumb tracing idle circles on his hand, eyes flicking down to his lips, then up again.

His bladder chose that moment to give an urgent twinge, ignoring his internal pleas to give whatever was about to happen a few more minutes to play out.

“Sorry, can you hold that thought? I need to”—he nodded his head in the direction of the bathroom, putting the beer bottle on the table.

“Yes, of course, I-I’ll wait here,” she said, looking somewhat flustered all of a sudden.

Evan didn’t have time to think more closely about her reaction, his urge growing stronger rapidly—as it always did the moment he decided to use the bathroom—forcing him to hurry down the hallway. Since he wasn’t wearing a pad any longer he grabbed himself through his pants as he stepped into the bathroom, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the wall to try and delay his bladder's automatic response to seeing a toilet.

He had gotten very good at opening the button on pants one-handed, so he kept a firm grip on himself with one hand while he reached down to pop the button open with the other—just … okay, these pants were a bit trickier than most other pants he owned, but no worries, he just needed a bit more leverage. He pushed harder with his thumb—nothing. Grabbed the tiny edge above the button the best he could and pulled—nothing.

And his bladder wasn’t having it anymore. They were obviously in a bathroom, the toilet was right there—out of sight or not—and what was the point of holding on when they were in the right place?? No, this was the right moment to let go.

“No, no, no, just a few more seconds, come on,” Evan hissed under his breath, squeezing himself harder, pulling frantically at his pants. Fucking Target piece of crap pants, come on! He knew he needed both of his hands to get them open, so he took a deep breath, tensing his muscles the hardest he could in the hope of activating some forgotten ounce of muscle control down there, and let go of his dick.

He got a few seconds of respite, and it was enough to finally get the button open and stumble in front of the toilet, but his heart sank as he got his hand down his boxers to pull himself out and was met with wetness. No, please, don’t let this happen twice in one evening. He cursed, urine soaking his fingers, getting all over the rim of the toilet and onto the floor before his aim struck true. He felt numb as his bladder emptied itself, Sydney’s words ringing in his head—It’s not a deal breaker, everyday thing or not—but instead of leaving him with a sense of comfort, they morphed. Everyday thing, or not. Not. Not.

She didn’t—she couldn’t have meant it, of course she couldn’t have. Not every day. Not twice in a fucking day.

He wiped the seat and the floor with some citrus-scented cleaning wipes he'd found beneath the sink before he turned his attention to himself. The front of his boxers was soaked and there was a big wet spot on his pants. Thankfully the spot on his pants wasn’t too visible because of the black fabric, and after a quick rinse in the bathroom sink, he was sure they wouldn’t smell of pee either. He deemed the boxers a lost cause though, and figured he could sneak past Sydney and stuff them down the bag where he put the wet clothes from earlier. It would be as if it'd never happened.

He could still turn the evening around.

I almost feel bad for putting Evan through this, haha. As usual my estimated chapter count has increased. There'll be 2-3 more chapters before it's over.

Chapter 4: I Get It

Evan held his breath as he walked carefully down the hallway. The couch wasn't facing the hallway, but it wasn't fully turned away from it either, so if Sydney wasn't focused on the TV or her phone she could easily see him walk past.

He glanced in her direction as he reached the doorway—she was leaning up against the armrest of the couch, back turned against him. Finally a bit of luck, Evan thought as he hurried over to the tied-up Target bag. Now he just needed to untie it and get the boxers inside.

The bag rustled as he worked to untie the hard knot he'd made earlier, but after some finicking, he got it open.

“Everything okay?”

Evan jumped at the unexpected interruption, hurrying to hide the soaked boxers behind his back as he turned toward Sydney's voice, but judging by the look on her face, she'd already seen them.

“Uh, I—”

“I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snuck up on you like that,” she said, taking a few steps back, almost hitting her head on a shelf in her hurry to get away. She gestured behind her, and stammered, “I'm just gonna … ” before turning around and disappearing through the doorway.

Fuck. That's it. That was the last straw for her. He should have just left at that point—gotten dressed and caught the next bus home, but ... damn it, he wanted some sort of closure. An explanation maybe, he didn't know, just … something. Anything. So he put the boxers into the bag and joined Sydney in the living room.

She glanced up at him as he walked in, but quickly averted her gaze again, clearing her throat. “I'm sorry, I … ”

“It’s too much for you, I get it. I'm leaving, I just wanted to … I don't know.”

“I don't want you to leave,” she said, almost too low for him to hear. “But you'll want to after I—shit, Evan, there's something I have to tell you.”

Wait. What?

“Okay?”

“I … I have this … thing, um, I-I don't know how to say this,” she said, looking utterly devastated.

What was going on?

“Syd, what—”

“It turns me on,” she said, words tumbling out.

“Wait … the”—Evan looked out into the hallway where she’d just seen him trying to hide his soaked boxers—”and the”—he splayed his hands out, gesturing down to his pants, alluding back to the first accident.

Sydney nodded, not meeting his eyes.

That was not what he’d expected. “Huh,” Evan said, sitting down on the couch, taking some time to gather his thoughts. “I've heard about it. Uh, about people liking that kind of thing.”

It was a bit ironic, wasn't it? That the thing he'd been fretting about, trying to make up for—the thing he counted as his biggest shortcoming—was something that turned her on. Relief flooded Evan as he realized Sydney wasn’t about to call it quits—that she’d meant it when she said it wasn’t a deal breaker, in more ways than he could have guessed. It was … actually kind of funny. Sydney jolted and looked at Evan with wide eyes as a laugh burst out of him.

“I'm—I’m sorry,” he managed to get out between laughs. “I swear I'm not laughing at you, it's just—what are the odds?” he said, another wave of laughter coming over him.

Sydney started smiling, a tentative laugh escaping her as Evan clutched at his stomach, trying to get a few deep breaths in and regain control of himself.

“God, I thought I'd ruined everything,” he said, leaning back on the couch, wiping tears from his eyes.

“Well … same,” Sydney said, tension easing from her shoulder. “It’s, uh, not something I tell people. I have, but, you know, bad reactions and all.”

“Yeah, I get it,” he said, turning to face Sydney. She still had a forlorn expression on her face, and Evan didn't want to make her feel worse, but there was something he needed to know. “Can I ask what it is about it that you like? Is it, like … a sadism thing, or?”

“No!” Sydney exclaimed. “No, it's—what happened earlier, in the parking lot, that’s not—” She turned to face Evan fully. “I don't want you—anyone—to feel bad. Back at the parking lot I just wanted you to feel better.”

“I mean, I wouldn't have felt bad if I had known,” Evan said, shrugging.

“Really?”

“Yeah, and … I kind of get it,” he said, reaching to pick up the beer he’d left on the table and taking a long drink from it, very aware of the way Sydney was looking at him—waiting for him to elaborate. “Okay, this might just be a ‘me’ thing, but if I know I’m not going to make it—and I’m not in the middle of a busy street or something—I’d much rather just … let go than be in pain from trying to hold it.”

Sydney’s eyes had turned wide, a blush on her cheeks. “Yeah, no, I-I agree.”

Evan met Sydney’s gaze, holding it as he emptied the last of his beer. There was a slight tremble in his hands as he put the bottle down. He knew he was about to take a risk. “Do you want to … watch another movie? And, uh, if I could get a glass of water?” He arched his brows, looking at her intently, hoping to convey that there was more to his question.

Sydney's chest rose as she inhaled sharply. “Do you—are you sure?” she asked, hand going to the fine necklace around her neck.

“Yeah, if you want to?”

“I do.”

“Then let’s do it.”

Since they’d barely watched the movie Evan had picked out earlier, they decided to watch it again rather than pick a new one. Sydney had gotten a pitcher of water and made sure to keep Evan’s glass topped up. As the movie started to wind down—the ruggedly handsome main character revealing that he did in fact manage to save some of the gold from the sinking ship—Evan was starting to get full. Fuller than he would have let himself get if he’d been trying to avoid an accident, so, in other words, perfectly full for the occasion.

“You know you kind of look like him,” Sydney said, nodding toward the TV.

“You think?” Evan said, holding back a smile. This was far from the first time he'd gotten likened to that actor.

“Oh, don't give me that. I refuse to believe you haven’t heard that one before.”

“Maybe once or twice … a week,” Evan said, smiling cheekily. “To be fair I mostly get it when I’m working the bar, and if you knew the shit drunk people say to try and get a free drink—after a while you just start filtering things out,” he said, chuckling.

“Well, I'm not drunk,” Sydney said, shuffling closer and running her fingers through his hair and down the side of his neck, sending a pleasant shiver down his body. “But I'd be lying if I said I didn't want something from you.”

She wet her lips before leaning in, pressing a soft kiss to his mouth. As she pulled back he must have looked as bereaved as he felt, cause Sydney smiled at him, wicked and sweet, and kissed him again. This time she didn't pull back, deepening the kiss, and Evan let his hand come up to cradle her jaw, silk-soft skin dancing beneath his fingers as she mouthed at him hungrily.

They kept kissing until they were both panting, Evan's body buzzing with arousal, and—he groaned, letting his hand fall into his lap, feeling Sydney's eyes on him as he ground his palm down, grabbing himself through his pants to quell the sudden spike of desperation. To be honest it was mostly for show, he was already hard enough that it was unlikely he would leak even if he didn't hold himself—but from the sharp inhale Sydney took at the sight, it had been the right decision.

“Sorry,” he said. “The water's starting to get to me.”

“Should we—can we move this to the bedroom?”

“I don't know how long I can hold it, your bed—”

“I don't care,” she said, blushing at the depravity of what she was suggesting, moving to stand up from the couch.

As Evan mirrored her action his bladder swooped, gravity testing the strength of his sphincter muscles, and he had to stand still, legs tightly crossed, for a few seconds to make sure he didn't start leaking—the obvious state of his desperation pulling a gasp from Sydney.

When the urge passed they moved to the bedroom and Sydney didn't waste a second after entering the dimly lit room before fisting her hands in the fabric of Evan's sweater and pulling him against her, stretching to close the distance between them, lips meeting in another heated kiss. Her hands traveled down his chest, tugging at the hem of his sweater, urging him to take it off.

Evan complied, pulling the sweater above his head and tossing it on the floor, starting to unbutton his shirt but was forced to pause and get a hand on his crotch as his bladder spasmed, threatening to leak.

“Let me help you,” Sydney said, voice a soft whisper, but instead of helping with the buttons as Evan had assumed she would, she replaced the hand on his dick with her own, wrapping her fingers around him in a firm grasp.

It wasn't uncommon for Evan to have to hold himself to keep from having an accident—hell, he often did it subconsciously whenever entering a bathroom—but it'd never felt like this. He was so sensitive, the need to pee a tingling ache, soothed and intensified at the same time by the way Sydney gently massaged him through the rough fabric of his pants. His breath stuttered, mind held hostage by the sensation.

A soft laugh from Sydney pulled him out of it. “Go on,” she said, amused smile reaching all the way up to her eyes as they flickered down to his half-buttoned shirt, task forgotten.

He made quick work of the rest of the buttons, his shirt joining the sweater on the floor. His need to pee returned sharply as Sydney let go of him in favor of stroking the newly exposed skin, kneading the soft-firm flesh of his chest before giving him a light push, causing him to fall onto the bed. He hissed as his control momentarily slipped, a gush of pee escaping, darkening the fabric of his pants.

“Shit,” he groaned, inspecting the damage, not bothering to be discreet about it. “That made me leak.”

“Can I feel?”

Evan nodded, leaning back on the bed as Sydney got her hands on him again, mapping out the wetness, eyes flicking up to Evan's, her pupils blown wide.

“Can you hold it?”

“For now.”

“Tell me when you—before you—”

“Okay.”

She pulled her shirt over her head and stepped out of her pants, leaving her in a cream-white bralette, her nipples a dark shadow beneath the sheer material, her belly softly rounded above the matching pair of panties. God, she was gorgeous. Evan bent to pull off his socks and his pants, leaving him with nothing on as he crawled up in bed, pulling the covers off as he went. Sydney climbed in next to him.

They started kissing again, Evan letting his hands roam across Sydney’s body, reveling in the way she arched into his touch, pushing in close, her thigh between his legs, the slow roll of her hips putting pressure in all the right places. He got lost in it—the wet slide of her lips against his, the quiet moans in the back of her throat, the drawn-out groan as he bit her lower lip gently. Her responses spurred him on, heat coiling low in his stomach, and he realized he could come just like that, against her leg—but he didn't want it to end so soon.

He broke off the kiss, letting his lips wander across her jaw, placing kisses down her neck and her chest instead, mouthing at her breasts through the lacy fabric. She arched her back, reaching behind and unclasping her bra, Evan helping to remove it before returning his attention to her breasts, kneading them as he kept on pressing kisses, pausing to breathe warm air across her nipple before sucking it into his mouth—Sydney moaning.

He pulled back, looking up at her through half-lidded eyes. “Can I go down on you?” he asked, closing his lips around her nipple again, getting a gasp in return as he let his tongue flick across it.

“Yeah, yes, please.”

He trailed kisses down her ribs, and her stomach while gently massaging her breasts, so soft beneath his hand. Even though the events so far this evening had given his confidence quite a blow, this, at least, he knew he was good at. And from the moans and gasps coming from Sydney—her hand firmly placed on his shoulder, urging him to move faster down her body—she thought so too.

When he reached down below her soft belly, quivering from the stuttered breaths she let out, he paused, tracing her panty line with his fingertips, a ghost of a touch across her mound. He could smell her, and it took all his willpower not to rip her panties off and bury his face between her legs, but he didn't want to rush this.

He pulled her panties down just below her hips, resting his hand on the inside of her thigh and letting his thumb slide across her lips, desire making him dizzy as he felt how wet she already was. He pulled down her panties the rest of the way, abandoning any pretense he'd had of taking it slow, and positioned himself between her legs, heat coursing through him at the sight.

“Oh God, yes,” she all but keened as he pressed the flat of his tongue against her, and he couldn't help but moan as he tasted her, spreading the wetness before flicking his tongue up, circling her clit. Her hand nestled into his hair and tugged sharply, the unexpected pain making him groan into her. “Sorry, sorry,” she gasped, her grip in his hair loosening.

He brought his hand up to hers, squeezing it, urging her to keep it there. “It’s okay,” he said, voice a low rumble. “Show me where you want me.”

“Oh fuck,” she groaned, the hand in Evan's hair tightening again, pulling him against her at the same time that she started moving her hips in small hitching movements, using his mouth to get herself off. It was intoxicating, the way she seemed to lose herself in it, and Evan couldn't help but get lost in it himself—mouthing and lapping at wet-slick folds, her thighs quivering against him.

Without warning a familiar warm-wet sensation spread against Evan's crotch making him suck in a breath, pushing his hips down hard into the mattress to stop the pooling liquid. He squeezed Sydney’s thigh to get her attention, pulling back.

“Syd,” he said, cursing as he felt another gush escape him, seeping into the fabric beneath him—he was at his breaking point. “I'm—shit, I'm leaking, I'm trying to stop it but—”

Sydney gripped his arm, tugging. “Come here, next to me—I want you next to me.”

Evan got up, the movement making him leak more heavily, his face burning at the sight of the wet spot on the sheets, at the dripping trail he left on the sheets as he moved to lay next to Sydney.

“Fuck—that's … you're so hot, holy shit,” Sydney said, erasing some of the shame Evan felt over his slipping control. Her hands brushed his stomach as she reached down, pausing in question. Evan answered by capturing her lips in his, groaning into her mouth as she got her hand around him, the wet sounds as she started stroking him making his face heat again.

It was that same sensation from earlier, the building intensity as she closed her fist around him tighter, pressure mounting, and releasing as he kept losing spurts of urine, the skin on Sydney's arm glistening wet, dripping onto the mattress beneath them. If it weren't for the way Sydney looked at him as if he was giving her all she'd ever wished for, he would have burned up from the embarrassment—but there was something thrilling about giving her this, giving up control instead of losing it.

She focused her attention on the head of his dick—quick, short strokes that had him questioning if he was about to come or piss himself completely, but at this point he didn't even care what happened, his world condensed to the points of contact between them—the kisses that'd turned sloppy and open-mouthed, tongues sliding together desperately, in contrast to her sure movements around him.

He noticed she had her hand between her legs, chasing her own release, and shit—he hadn’t even made her come yet. He'd make it up to her after … after—all thoughts left Evan's mind as Sydney started stroking him deeper, and this time there was no doubt what was about to happen.

“Syd, fuck, I'm—” is all Evan managed to get out before his body tensed, orgasm ripped out of him in rippling waves of pleasure, washing over him as Sydney worked him through it.

Her hand was still wrapped loosely around him, not moving, when he felt pressure build again and for a moment he was confused, he just came, he couldn't—oh. Shit. His eyes snapped up to Sydney's, a spike of panic coursing through him, his instincts screaming at him that no, no, no, it can't happen here, in bed, in front of Sydney.

“Hey, you're okay, it's okay,” Sydney said, hand coming up to his face, stroking gently, making him realize he'd been clenching his jaw. “I have an en-suite if you want to … ”

Evan's brain connected again, remembering how much Sydney had seemed to enjoy everything that had happened so far, noticing the flush to her cheeks, traveling down her chest, her eyes dark and half-lidded. She wanted this, and he wanted to give it to her.

“No, no, it's—” He inhaled sharply, cutting himself off as he felt, and heard, a powerful spurt escape him, the distinct hissing sound pulling Sydney's attention down, her breath hitching at the sight. “It’s too late, shit, Syd—I can't hold it.”

She sucked in a breath, gripping Evan's shoulder tightly as he relaxed into it, giving his body permission to let go. There was no hesitation, no slow trickling start, as his body seized the opportunity—the wet spot beneath them growing rapidly as urine rushed out of him, warmth spreading up the side of his stomach, the smell of wet cotton and diluted pee filling the air.

Sydney made a desperate, choked-off sound, hand still gripping Evan's shoulder, her other hand splayed in the wetness on the sheets between them. Evan gripped her hip and pulled her closer, slotting his leg between hers, slotting their mouths together again, the kiss all tongue and breathy moans. Sydney hitched her leg over Evan’s hip, pressing even closer, a rhythmic roll against him, against soaking wet skin—hot, and slick—the sounds it produced making him blush, making him burn.

“Oh, fuck, Evan,” Sydney gasped between kisses, flicking her tongue across Evan’s lip, shoving up harder against his thigh, moving faster and faster, and he was breathing her gasps, swallowing her moans as she tensed up, gripping his shoulder so hard that he’d find bruises there days after, her eyes clenched shut as she cried out, a sudden gush of warmth against his thigh as she came, shaking.

He kept kissing her, stroking her back, her ass, down her thigh, as she kept rocking against him languidly, dragging the pleasure out, their skin sticking together, sheets starting to cool.

Sydney was the one to break the silence. “That was—God,” she said, laughing. “I’m—that’s never happened to me with—when I’m with someone else.”

Evan’s brows knit together, confused. “Hm?”

Sydney stroked his thigh with her thumb, where he was still wet from her release. “I made a mess,” she said quietly, looking up at him.

His mouth quirked with a smile. “You made a mess?”

“Okay, you win … ” she said, nudging him to lay on his back so she could place her head on his chest, her leg still slung across his body. She exhaled satedly. “This time.”

THE END
