Authors note …. hello hello I just got a great idea for a story. I won’t spoil too much but it’s based on Lily’s day off, a video game. Although I’m using my characters.

“It’s about time you decided to write something, I was getting bored, Are you ready for the next installment in this multiverse audience?”

Yeah I wanna say there’s a multiverse involving my characters but I only have 2 versions of Tina.

“There’s that one from accident report,”

Yeah but that got downvoted immediately so I killed that version of you.

“You killed me!”

Yea

“Oh ok”

Then without further adieu.LEEEEEEETS GET READY TO RUMBBBBLE.

Chapter 1 average Joe

So you wake up wearing nothing but white, you can’t remember your name, or anything else for that matter.

As you look around in a daze you hear a voice, a girls crying to be exact. You turn around the corner to see who it is.

You see a girl wearing a tank top, skirt, and a bow on her head. Everything about her looked average, yet you couldn’t help but feel endeared to her. A name comes into your head “Tina”

You snap out of your trance when you remember she’s still crying. You go up to her.

“Excuse me miss are you alright?”

She looks up and still puffy eyed responds “No I can’t remember anything except that my name is Tina,”

“What a coincidence! I can’t remember anything either!” You say as you hand her a tissue.

“Then let’s find our memories together!” She says cheerfully. As though she hadn’t even been crying before.

You are taken back by this change in mood, but go along anyways because you feel so endeared.

She pipes up again “How about we go to the police station? Perhaps our family’s have called looking for us?”

So the two of you ask around and are told the direction of the police station. As you walk the distance you notice her shifting uncomfortably.

“Are you ok? You look a bit wobbly,”

“Oh it’s fine I just need to pee, I’ll just go when we get to the police station,” she blushes as she waves her arm in a dismissive manner.

As you continue walking around the town Tina begins showing more signs of desperation really quick. She starts bouncing, crossing her legs, and holding herself.

“Actually I don’t think I can make it I really needed to pee even before you talked to me,”

“Then we’ll go in the supermarket right here,” You day gesturing to the large building you were walking next to.

You go inside and ask the cashier about the bathroom. She says only paying customers can have the key use it and Tina groans. So you buy a candy bar to appease the cashier.

She tells you the bathrooms are in the back as Tina becomes more desperate by the second. She hunches over and buries both hands in her crotch.

“Hand on hang on we can make it!” You say loudly as you grab her hand dragging her to the ladies room.

In front of the door you hear a pitter patter as Tina leaks onto the floor.

She tears up a little “No I can.. I can…. I can’t hold it!”

HERE'S THE WETTING FOR THE SKIMMERS SUCH AS MYSELF

A hiss comes from the poor girl as a stream of urine pours out from her, soaking her panties and creating a puddle on the floor. She begins crying as her endeavor ends and instead holds her skirt so it won’t get wet.

The pee comes out with such force that it splatters on the ground and surprisingly only gets the panties and bottoms of shoes wet. You can’t help but feel a little bit aroused but you still feel more bad for the poor girl.

Eventually the pee stream ends as it drips a little from the completely soaked panties.

“I can’t believe I just did that,” Tina whispers.

You feel you need to do something. “Ok go into the bathroom and clean yourself I’ll clean up the puddle and when it’s clean I’ll tell you when you can get out ok?”

“Ok,” the maiden answers dazed.

She enters the bathroom to freshen herself up while you take some paper towels to clean the urine. Luckily it was a slow day in the supermarket so absolutely nobody saw what happened.

You leave her in the bathroom while you give the key to the cashier and exit the supermarket.

You enter the conveniently placed Victoria’s Secret across from the supermarket and enter to buy a set of underwear, ignoring the stares the people give you as a single man buying ladies underwear.

You pay for the undies and re-enter the market. You knock on the door for Tina to come out.

“What took you so long?” She says while puffing her cheeks.

“I had to go get you a present?” And you show her what you bought.

She looks at you, stunned. “Why would you get this for me?”

“I felt bad so I bought you down dry underwear.”

She tears up, but out of joy this time, “Thank you his is the nicest thing anyone’s done for me,”

“All in a day's work,”

She goes inside to put it on under her clothes and then walks out. “Thank you I love them!”

“You’re wel-

Suddenly a group of men in suits round the corner of the isle.

The one in front bursts out “Tina honey we’ve been looking all over for you! Your show starts in 10 minutes!come on come on we have to leave!”

“Wait a second I need a little time to-

No time no time!” He grabs her by the wrist and leaves.

4 months later

So it’s been 3 months since you found your memories. Just an average Joe working middle management at a paper company. Turns out that girl you met 4 months ago was some famous singer.

You look out your window of the office and wonder if things could have worked out different if you said something else to her.

Meanwhile Tina looks out the window of her mansion. She smiles sadly as she looks at the gift you gave her 4 months ago.

So you wake up wearing nothing but office wear…..

End of chapter 1

Authors note …..I hope you like the story and catch my drift from that last line.

“Aw man that ending was too sad!”

Then maybe we can change it next time

“Next time?”

Thank you for reading, please leave comments and criticism down below. Merry Christmas and a Happy New year.

Authors note …. hello hello, it’s been too long. I decided to write up chapter 2 to this story since I still think it has potential.Anyhow the idea is that little changes affect what happens at certain points so the story’s gonna repeat parts a lot.

You know sometimes I think you’re just too lazy, you need to write more so you can TAKE OVER THE WO-

*cough* be more of an influence in this realm, I worry about you sometimes,”

Thanks for that. I’ll keep you in mind for the future.

Anyways enough of that. Without further adieu LLLLLLLETS GET READY TO RRRRRRUMBLE!

Chapter 2 love with an idol

So you wake up wearing nothing but office wear, you can’t remember your name, or anything else for that matter.

She tears up, but out of joy this time. “Thank you this is the nicest thing anyone’s ever done for me!

“Hang on I have another surprise,”

The two of you walk out of the store, as you look back you see several black vans in the parking lot. You dismiss it as nothing.

Eventually you and Tina reach your destination.

“Ta-da! Ice cream!”

“Oh wow this is too much!” The pretty girl exclaimed in joy.

After you place your orders for chocolate and mint flavors respectively, Tina blushes a little and squirms.

“You’re sure are squirming a lot, Do you still need to pee?”

She blushes harder and pushes you like a tsundere would. “Don’t say that in public idiot! Besides it’s not that,” she says softly.

You and the blushing girl beside you get the frozen treats and sit at a table for 2.

Tina stares at her ice cream and then you, “*sigh* I’m finally going to be honest with you,”

“What?”

“I actually still have all my memories, I’m a famous idol who came back to my hometown for a concert, while here I decided to ditch my manager for a little to find my childhood friend,”

You stare unimpressed “and what does this have to do with me?”

“I’ll get to that….. you are my childhood friend ….. and after this day we’ve had…” she begins to tear up a little.” I fallen in love with you, I don’t want to go back to idol life anymore, it’s too stressful…” she begins full on crying.” I just want to stay here with you,”

……

……

……”Are you still there?”

You feel a burning sensation in your head, as though another person was trying to break in there… no I take it back.. someone is trying to break in.

You remember times like this eating ice cream with your best friend, you remember times like this comforting your friend, but most importantly, you remember a time like this……

Falling in love with your best friend

“I remember now,” Tina’s head perks up at this.

“Tina I … I remember you… and I remember… that I’ve always wanted to be with you forever,”

Tina smiles through her tears.

“Tina, please let me be your boyfriend, so we can always be together.

Tina practically screams “YES YES!”

4 months later

It had been a while since Tina quit her idol life. Of course fans were disappointed and the media kept harassing you and your girlfriend.. but it all settled down after a month.

Tina’s money would help last the two of you a while as you spend your days taking walks in the park and feeding birds.

As you lie in a blanket next to your one true love, a single thought enters your head. Perhaps you were more than than just some average Joe.

So you wake up with an “I’m with her” shirt on

Authors note…. So I hope you like it. Sorry there’s technically no new wetting in it but I really liked the ending. I hope to make at least 3 different storylines of this.

“Yes the mystery and intrigue continue, which will be found out by ME detective Tina!”

More like “defective Tina” Since when were you a detective.

“Since just now!”

I hope you liked please leave comments as well as criticism down below. It’s a new year for new beginnings.

With love Ghostblade(stay thirsty my friends)
