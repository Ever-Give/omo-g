Chapter 11 - Our Little Secret

“Okay, so for the first day, we'll walk 12 miles, pretty flat terrain, so I figure it'll take us maybe four or five hours depending on how many breaks we take,” Marcus says, letting his finger follow the day one trail on the map spread out before him.

Avery and Marcus have been planning a fall hiking trip for a couple of weeks now and there are just the last details left.

Marcus continues, pointing to another paper. “There's plenty of restrooms along the trail, so you don't have to worry about that.”

“It’s a five-hour hike, Marcus, I won't need them.”

Marcus clears his throat, feeling his face heat slightly. Even though he's been … indulging in his kink quite a lot lately he still doesn't have close to the bladder capacity Avery has and he knows it's stupid, okay, but he's a bit embarrassed about it. Since they started going steady and spending almost all their time together he’s noticed that it's almost always him who suggests toilet breaks; having to use the restroom after a two-hour movie, and way too much soda, at the theater, or the time he had to ask Avery—who finally got her driver's license—to stop the car so he could pee at the side of the road because he refused to be the one to ask for a toilet break until he realized, 20 minutes from their destination, that he wouldn't be able to hold on for another minute. Avery pulled over as quickly as she could after he asked her, of course, and he was grateful that she didn't mention the wet spot on his green cargo pants when he got back into the car.

Avery bumps his shoulder. “We'll stop if you need to, of course. It's not like I haven't been hiking with you before,” she chuckles.

“Do I pee too much? Or, too often,” Marcus blurts out.

Avery looks surprised by the sudden question. “Well … yeah? Or, I mean, I might not be the right person to ask,” Avery says, turning in her chair to face him. “Where is this coming from?”

“I don't know.”

Avery waits.

Marcus huffs out a breath. “I just … I've been reading online, about the stuff I like, and other people that like the same stuff are doing, like, 24-hour holds and measuring and it's liters, Avery, liters of pee and—”

“Okay, let me stop you right there.” Marcus closes his mouth, looking at Avery. “Let me ask you something. Do you want to hold it for 24 hours? Or pee liters?”

“Well, maybe not 24 hours, it's not like it's that fun holding,” Marcus mumbles.

“Do you think it's fun holding at all?”

“Up to a point, I guess. I like the, uh, conclusion the best.”

Avery purses her lips, her eyes wandering. “What are you wearing for the hike?”

Marcus' eyebrows knit together. “Uh, I got a bunch of different shorts, and tights to pair them with if it gets cold or—”

“Any black ones?”

“Some of them.”

“Go get a pair and meet me in the bathroom.”

When Marcus gets to the bathroom, black hiking shorts in hand, he doesn't know what to expect. Avery doesn't usually initiate when it comes to Marcus’ kink, so he doesn't want to get his hopes up.

Avery is leaning against the vanity, her eyes traveling down his body to the shorts before snapping back up. “Wanna put them on?”

Oh, she does not have to ask twice. Marcus navy sweatpants hit the floor and a few seconds later he’s pulling up the shorts, fastening the buttons, and pulling up the zipper. The fabric of the shorts is lightweight, but not thin, and it reminds Marcus of the fabric of one of his jackets that’s designed to withstand a bit of rain. He smooths the fabric with his hands and looks up at Avery. “These are the ones I planned on wearing the first day.”

“Okay, good, can I tell you what I’m thinking?”

“Yeah, of course.”

“Okay, so, you obviously got some sort of hang-up around holding it and not asking to use the bathroom even when you clearly need it.” Marcus opens his mouth to argue, but Avery continues. “Don’t tell me I’m wrong, because I’m not, right?”

“No, you’re right … but what does that have to do with … ” Marcus waves his hands indicating the shorts he’s wearing.

Avery blushes. “I just … thought it might be a solution. I, uh, was thinking back to that day at the beach and what you said afterward about choosing those swim trunks because they didn’t show wetness, and well, I don’t think these would show wetness either,” Avery says, nodding toward the shorts. “So we wouldn’t have to take pee breaks. I get that it’s not, like, a general solution to your problem, but I don’t know, might be fun to try it?”

A smile spreads across Marcus’ face, along with a warm feeling in his chest, as he looks at Avery. The blush on her cheeks is spreading down her chest, beneath the low neckline of the loose singlet she’s wearing. She’s twisting her hands, waiting for Marcus’ answer.

“You’d be okay with that?”

“Well, as long as it's our little secret,” she says, stepping closer to Marcus and stroking the dark fabric of his shorts. “Let's see if these pass the test, hm?”

Marcus swallows, staring down at Avery, not sure if she has the same “test” in mind as he does. She could mean for him to head into the shower, or go to the sink, and splash the shorts with water. He doesn't want to assume, it feels fragile, this moment.

“Do you need to go?” Avery asks, quiet enough that Marcus barely hears her.

Okay, they do have the same test in mind. Avery steps back, leaning against the vanity again, her cheeks flushed and eyes dark. Is this … does she like this?

She clears her throat. “You can, uh, go ahead if you need to.”

Marcus blinks, snapping out of the Oh my god is this actually happening?? mode he's been in the past couple of minutes. “Yeah, yeah, of course. I'll just … yeah.”

It takes him a minute to relax enough to feel that tingle, the loosening of the sphincter muscle, that almost imperceptible pull he gets before his bladder decides it's okay to let go.

He starts by letting out a small gush, tensing his stomach muscles to make it push out of him, creating a large shimmering spot on his shorts. Avery sucks in a breath, eyes trained on his crotch.

He holds off for a bit, letting it soak in, and looks down to see if it shows. There's a slight dark shadow there, but it's no more visible than on his swimming trunks. He shudders as he relaxes again, another short burst of hot piss warming the fabric at his thigh.

“Shit, that feels good,” he says, moving his hand to squeeze himself through the wet fabric, but stopping himself, unsure if he's allowed to.

“Pretend I'm not here.” Avery is grabbing the countertop hard, voice breathy. “Show me how you do it when you're alone.”

Fuck.

A spike of arousal goes through Marcus at her words, his hand twitching with the need to grab himself. He meets her gaze and takes a deep breath in that leaves him on a shuddering sigh as he lets the last of his control slip.

The fabric is already soaked through and piss starts pouring down his leg, splashing against the tiled floor. He groans as he grabs himself, liquid pooling in his hand before trickling out, running over the back of his hand, between his fingers. He adjusts himself, letting urine saturate the other leg as well, the puddles at his feet connecting.

It doesn't take long for his stream to taper off—he wouldn't have used the bathroom earlier if he knew this would happen—and his hand is trembling when he moves it out of the way, some small part of his brain that's still working reminding him of the purpose with all this.

“Pass the test?” he asks, voice not as sure as he wishes it to be, a sudden need for approval—of the situation, of him—leaves him feeling a bit frayed at the edges.

“What?” Avery asks, looking up at him—eyes wide, cheeks flushed.

“The shorts, does it show?” he says, smiling at how flustered Avery is, his nervousness easing.

“No, it looks good, uh, looks—nothing. Shows nothing. Fuck,” she says, a huffed laugh escaping her. “Yeah, they pass the test.”

Marcus brushes a hand over the shorts, the fabric already feeling more damp than wet. His cotton boxers are still clinging to him tightly though, still soaked. That'll probably get uncomfortable when hiking, but right now he has trouble not grinding a palm against himself to release some of the pressure as he grows harder by the second. Avery had said to show him what he does when he's alone—but he doesn't think watching him rub one out through piss-soaked shorts and coming in ten seconds flat is what she had in mind when she said that, so he keeps his hands firmly by his side.

She’s not blind though.

“Do you usually, uh, leave it like that?” she asks, eyes flicking down to his crotch, a mischievous grin spreading on her face as she steps closer.

“No-oh,” he groans as she grabs him through the shorts.

“Let’s get in the shower and I'll help you out.”

Out in the kitchen, a gust of wind coming from the open balcony door blows the itinerary for the trip off the table, papers scattering all over the floor, and if the paper detailing the restrooms along the trails blows under the fridge? Well, neither Marcus nor Avery will miss it.

- THE END -

Thank you all for reading! 💛 The story that was supposed to be a one-shot ended up being nearly 24,000 words, haha, but I had a lot of fun writing it.

Are you going to write some more adventures as they are such a good read. What can you think up next?

I do have a spin-off planned--a male omo, kink discovery kind of story centered around Marcus.

Not a crowd-pleaser, I'm sure, but I'm really into male omo right now so 😂
