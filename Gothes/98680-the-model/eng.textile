The model

I didn’t want to do it, I told her I wasn’t interest and yet there I was, grumpily walking up the street, by myself underneath the orange lights, to my friend’s house. Her name’s Joana, but I call her Jonny. She’s an artist (and when I say artist I mean ARTIST) who has recently started to give evening lessons in figure drawing, and they’re doing surprisingly well considering this town’s overall resentment and ignorance towards everything artistic.

Usually she has her go to models that pose for her students during the lessons. Attractive women most of the time and yet she had the audacity to ask me, a bunch of times, if I was interested in modeling for her pupils. I always turned down the offers. Mainly because I’m an almost 50 year old mother with a body that gets lumpier with every passing month. Jonny kept telling me that in art every body type has it’s own unique aesthetic, which may be true but I was nonetheless way to insecure to let a bunch of students observe every little deformity that I may or may not have.

Anyway, despite my wishes not to be a part of this, I got a desperate call from Jonny one day, an hour before the start of one of her lessons. She explained to me that Laura, the model that was supposed to be there, couldn’t be present that evening because she accidentally broke a rib after sneezing to hard. Which was hilarious! Jonny however wasn’t that amused. She proceeded to beg me in a million different ways to replace Laura that night. Jonny was in such despair that I felt as if she was on her knees begging me at some point during the call. But there was no way I was going to undress infront of a bunch of strangers. I gave my best to find excuses and ways to avoid doing this favour, but unfortunately I had to give in. I agreed but under the condition that I was going to do it with my underwear on. Jonny saw it as a fair deal … and that is why I got out into that painfully cold october air that night to see my friend.

Inside her home Jonny had this empty room that she turned into a fully functioning classroom, a small one but professional looking nontheless.

As I entered everybody was already there, seven faces of art enthusiasts stared at me with their pencils ready. I was about ten minutes late, on purpose, because I wanted Jonny to know how much I didn’t want to do that. She welcomed me with open arms and introduced me to the group: “Everyone, this is my friend Olivia, she’ll be our model for today.”

I looked around and I was sure I was seeing some faces already checking me out. Some looked disappointed, I bet Laura was one of those women who had the body shape of a goddess, whereas mine mostly resembled a failed pottery project.

“You ready?”, Jonny asked me. She knew my answer so I just looked at her in disapproval rather than uttering a word.

“You can undress yourself over there”, she showed me a tiny folding wall, the ones that you usually see in old movies. At least I had a little privacy.

Jacket and beanie were the first to come off, then, with shaking hands I took a deep breath and began to remove everything else. My body was still defreezing from the angry air outside but the room was nice and warm and I quickly found comfort (temperature wise).

“You ready?” Jonny’s face suddenly peeked behind the wall and gave me a scare.

“Nervous”, I said shivering as I took my socks off.

“It’ll be fine you’ll see. Come on!”

She grabbed me by the hand and guided my heavy butt over to a chair she had placed in front of the students who were gathered there in a half circle. And all of them were staring at me, I don’t think I’d ever felt this uncomfortable before. The nervousness made me need to go pee, but I ignored it for I had other worries.

“Take whatever pose you want. Just make it comfortable because you’re gonna have to hold that one for 30 minutes.” Jonny told me, and so I did.

14 eyes of different colors and ages were now scanning me from top to bottom, what an unpleasant feeling that was. Funnily enough though, as time went by my anxiety began to settle and I even started to feel comfortable on that wooden chair. I was slowly realizing that once again all the worries and negative emotions I went through were just a product of unecessary paranoia. I felt my body relaxing, even though I had to pee a little bit more than before. I guess the cold didn’t help in this regard either, or the cup of tea I drank before starting. But I wasn’t worried, the first break was about to come anyway.

“Alright everybody! Time’s up!” And the sudden sound of seven pencils being put away simultaneously was to be heard.

“Five minute break!”, said Jonny

Some were standing up, others were still working on their piece, others were leaving the room to take a piss probably. I didn’t think that my turn for that would come in those five minutes, but again, I wasn’t worried.

“How was it?” Jonny asked curious. It was hard for me to admit after all that drama I made her go through, but it was surprisingly enjoyable. My friend smiled as big as only she can and began to lead me around and take a look at everybody’s drawings.

There were some really good ones amongst them. It was also odd to see an artwork of yourself on a piece of paper, and from different angles too. Quite exciting actually - and I didn’t look as bad as I thought, I guess I had picked the right pose.

Once our little tour reached the initial starting point again, Jonny took me aside and asked quietly: “Now that you feel more comfortable, would you like to try and undress completely?”

I stared at her with big eyes and very little desire to show them my boobs.

“Pleeeaaaseee, Olive, you would do me a massive favour.”

I was hesitant, very hesitant but I’d be lying if I say that a part of me wasn’t thinking about it. Sitting on that chair and then looking at all the drawings gave me an unexpected sense of appreciation towards my body, it sure was a nice confidence boost. Maybe getting naked wasn’t that bad of an idea. Jonny saw that the wheels in my head were spinning and kept trying to break through my insecurity.

“All right I’ll do it!”, I whispered, imediately questioning what I had just said. She gave me a warm happy-friend-hug before I walked back to my little hiding spot to get the last pieces of fabric off my body.

I heard Jonny clapping her hands followed by the sentence: “Ok, get ready we’ll be doing nude drawings now.”

I was shaking again. Suddenly all my self-doubt came back to haunt me once more. I saw the fat on my body, felt the weight of my saggy breasts, the shape of my butt. My confidence suddely dropped… but at least I trimmed my vagina so it wasn’t a total disaster.

I took a deep breath, ignored my steadily growing need to pee (that was only getting worse from the excitement) and walked over to my chair. I looked at all the student’s faces and surprisingly nobody really seemed to care that I was now exposing myself to them. All were to busy sharpening pencils or changing the page. It all helped and as I looked over to Jonny she gave me an encouraging wink and started the timer for the second time.

I was crossing my legs this time to avoid unexpected leaks coming from out of my you know what. It was probably the tea that returned to say hello and the longer I sat there the more my groin began to sting. Something wanted to come out, and we weren’t even halfway through our time. As everybody was focused on their work my mind was already planning out my way to the bathroom. And then I realized: “Shit! I can’t just go there completely naked!”

The toilet was upstairs, next to the living room. Jonny’s husband and child were definetly there somewhere. I had to get dressed before, but was it worth the effort in those five minutes? It wasn’t much time after all and my friend is very sensitive when it comes to her timeline. After all that’s why I arrived late, I just wanted to piss her off. And speaking of pissing, I was getting really uncomfortable on that chair. I wanted to squirm and shake but with all the people meticulously looking at me I couldn’t risk it. I was starting to sweat and my breath was getting heavier. At some point I felt both of Jonny’s hands on my shoulders and a sentence flying over my head: “Time’s up! Change of pose.”

“What?!”, I thought “No break?”, I asked.

“We are suffering from a bit of time pressure because we started later than usual. So we’re just gonna go straight into the final phase so that we can all finish off in time.”

Of course karma had to come back to bite me in the ass. Oh how I was panicking all of a sudden. I had, and I mean I HAD to go pee, but I just couldn’t do anything about it. To make matters worse, Jonny asked me if I could try to assume a pose that was more “open”.

“Open?”, I asked confused.

“Yes, please. You were so cramped together on that chair, it would be great if you could sit in a more relaxed position. Like when you’re at home or with friends. Show us your body, Olivia!”

The suspicious part of me was thinking that she was doing all of this on purpose. But I didn’t want to get paranoid again, so I just obeyed and ignored my needs.

“You can do it, Olive”, I told myself.

I squirmed around in the chair until I found a pose that didn’t just satisfy Jonny’s needs but was also convenient enough to hide MY needs. I placed my body in a way that my pussy would press against the edge of the chair thus helping me to keep the fluids in without risking to use my hands at some point. Jonny seemed happy and finally started the final drawing session.

“15 minutes this time!”, she said “Let’s make it a bit more challenging!”

Some students were giggling others seemed overwhelmed, I however felt relieved. Fifteen minutes less meant for me a higher chance of not pissing myself infront of everybody. In order to do that however, I had to find distractions and think happy thoughts … but I couldn’t. I was so desperate that all I could think of were toilets, pee streams and water noises. I had to go so incredibly bad, and with each minute that passed my bladder filled up a little bit more.

I started to squirm in my seat, subtly at first but my movements became more and more obvious as time went by. Even my stone face that I had throughout the evening began to show emotions of struggle, pain and fear. Jonny who was always walking around looking at the works in progress at some point looked up at me and asked: “You alright, Olive?”

I panicked, giggled nervously and just whispered: “This pose is more uncomfortable than I thought.”

She smiled, as did the students, and jokingly said: “Mmmh rookie mistake, Olivia. You gotta be tough now, we’re already halway through. Just keep holding it.”

I was surprised that this much time had already passed. It gave me hope. But… as I was thinking it, a little bit of something escaped my vagina. I twitched and squeezed my muscles together. Some artist had my pussy pointed exactly pointed towards them, I was praying that it went unnoticed. Then, without making it obvious, I looked down and saw how a few drops of urine were now dripping down the edge of the chair and onto the floor. I got really nervous and could feel my face turn red. Somebody just had to notice. I looked around but all those faces looked so focused that maybe I had a chance of getting away with it. With a swift motion of my thigh I wiped away the evidence and got back into my pose, apologizing to the room for moving, with a dying: “Sorry.”

Bullet dodged. The chances though of this happening again weren’t thin, I had to be careful … but I just had to take a massive piss. I just wanted to leave, go pee, relieve myself, get free from this infuriating pain. I could feel my whole body shaking and my bladder muscles burning behind my sealed pussy lips. A decision had to be made. I was unsure whether I should tell them that I needed a break or if I should just give it all to hold on and hope for the best. The first option was the one that made the most sense. But then I remembered that I was still naked and if I wanted to go upstairs I had to put some clothes on. Would I’ve been able to do that without losing control? It was such a shitty situation to be in!

“How much time, Jonny?” I asked. A hint if despair accompanied my voice.

“4 minutes! Hang in there.”

She had no idea what I was going through, and 4 minutes felt like another year. The control I had over my body began to crumble, I was losing my pose and so much more. I wasn’t going to endure all of that for much longer. I kept having moments where I opened my mouth trying to tell everybody about my urgent necessity but I just couldn’t bring myself to it.The embarrassment was to strong.

By that point however, with the few minutes that were still left, there was no reason to stop the session anymore. I gently moved my butt a little more towards the verge of the chair so that it’s edge would cut itself even deeper between my lips, trying simultaneously to move my weight downwards so that it would all get pressed together nicely.

“Don’t lose it. Stay calm!”, I kept repeating in my head. I was so scared of the possible impending desaster. Then, just when my sight began to get blurry, Jonny said the magic words: “Aaalright, time’s up! … and we’re done for tonight.”

“Ok, what do I do now?”, I immediately thought. The students were standing up, walking around, putting their jackes on, talking, there was quite a bit of confusion in the room. I remained seated. My bladder was pressing so hard that I couldn’t risk standing up. Jonny came over to me smiling and wrapped her hand around me. Her touch was cold and sent shivers down my body and some of them tickled the tip of my peehole. I twitched. My friend held me tight and then announced to the whole class: “Everybody, I think we should all thank Olive for being with us tonight…”

“Oh God, please shut up and let me go”, the voice in my head said.

“It was her first time doing this and I think we can all agree that she did a wonderful job.”

I looked around awkwardly with a forced smile on my face. I sat there bent forward, with both hands clenching the sides of the chair and my legs pressed together tight.

“I think she deserves a round of applause!”, said Jonny and a wave of half hearted claps made my face turn red. There were so many reasons to feel awkward about it.

As they were all clapping, Jonny whispered a gentle “Thank you” in my ear and while doing so she rubbed her cold hand on my back. This good hearted gesture made me all giddy and a spurt of the finest urine spread out between my naked thighs.

“Jonny…”, I whispered desperately as I felt her walking away from me.

She must’ve noticed the discomfort in my face that she immediately asked: “Are you Ok? You did good!”

“I have to pee so bad, Jonny!” I said even quieter.

She put her cold hand on my back again and got close to me whispering: “Then go! You know where the bathroom is!”

“I can’t," I replied, fighting for my life “If I stand up now I’m gonna flood the whole room.”

“That bad?”

All I could do was give her a nod.

“Oh no, sweety…” She was genuinely concerned about me. I saw her frantically looking around and then moving her head back towards my ear and quietly said: “There’s a big, empty bowl on the shelf behind you. If it as urgent as you say I’ll let you pee in it once everybody is gone.”

“Oh God, yes!” I replied. My excitement however only lasted a few seconds. As Jonny turned around she was approached by two of her students, the last ones left in the room, with their works in their hands to ask for some criticism.

“Oh fuck off!”, I thought.

Before moving her attention towards them Jonny hastily whispered into my ear: “Hold on! I’ll be with you in a second.”

I pressed and I squeezed, I gasped and grinded my teeth. My whole body was burning with tension, I felt like fainting.

To my right I heard voices talking about proportions, and shading and whatever. And then a question, followed by an answer, then another question. They talked for an eternity as eventually their discussion got interruped by the sudden sound of splashes and painful squeals. In the corner of my eye I saw three faces turning towards me as the bladder I oh so trusted crumbled under the intense pressure of its content. Defeated I let my head fall heavy onto my chest as a broken fountain of warm urine began to pour out onto the chair and over its edges. The room filled up with the sharp hissing noise of my stream. My feet felt warm and so were my legs, puddles were forming.

I let out a strained moan of relief but I quickly bit my lip before it could fully escape my mouth. Underneath the splashes I could hear gasps of surprise and confusion. My neighbours were staring in disbelief at what was gushing out of me.

The embarrassment was to much and I burst into tears, and I fully became a wet mess.

“I’m sorry”, I cried with my face buried into my hands.

“Oh no, Olive…”, my friend whispered as gentle as she could. She then turned to the others and said: “Let’s talk about this next week. You should go home now.”

The students obeyed without saying a word and began to pack their things … all while I was still peeing.

Jonny placed herself in front of me, maybe to give me cover from the others, and kindly wiped the tears of my face … all while I was still peeing.

The students wished us goodbye, Jonny waved her hand at them … and I just couldn’t. Stop. Peeing!

Once the two of us were left alone, the tension settled, embarrassment however reigned proudly over me.

“Olive, dear, why didn’t you say anything earlier?”

Sobbing uncontrollably I tried to explain everything to her. Luckily she seemed understanding.

“Rookie mistake…”, she said once again. We both laughed a little. By that point the last few drops escaped my body and I sat in an uncomfortably warm puddle of urine, while my friend was standing with both feet in it. I continued to apologize and offered to clean it up. Jonny barely payed attention to what I said and just gazed at my mess. Then, much to my surprise, she lifted her dress, pulled her green panties aside and began to piss onto the floor aswell. Confused was an understatement on how I was feeling in that moment. My eyes followed her stream pouring out of her pussy and down into my massive puddle. Hers was more of a light dribble compared to what had gushed out of me. It was yellow and its smell was rather pungent. The sound it made though seemed happy and innocent.

Her explanation for this behaviour was the sudden desire to turn the discomfort into a “pretentious stage performance for the nonexistent audience”.

An artist’s brain, go figure!

I on the other hand can only consider myself lucky that she didn’t get mad at me for messing up her chair or traumatizing her students.

Weeks have now passed since this accident and I must say, the longer I think about it the more I feel drawn (pun not intended) towards everything that has happened. The feeling of having a full bladder while everyone around you is unaware of it is a strange but quite exciting feeling, almost arousing I dare say.

I talked with Jonny about this the other day, and all she said was: “We should do this again!”

Thanks! It's been a while. I've written so many stories during this past year and I wasn't able to finish a single one.

I hope that things are gonna change now with this one 🙂
