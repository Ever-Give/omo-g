Ah, all good! Even if you don't take commissions, if you ever wanted to use my OC, Sarai, for some pants wetting art, you are more than welcome to! 🙂

Hi guys! Sorry that I haven't updated the story in the past weeks. Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish everything on time for Christmas. I've been struggling with some emotional issues lately (nothing bad don't worry) that kept me from completing the final drawings.

I'm gonna try and finish it once I'm back on track, so please be a patient for a little longer 🙂

As for now I wish you all a happy Christmas and I will see you soon!

Ok, the Christmas break has helped. Guys, get ready for the final part 🙂

###

Tilly wasn’t far away from a humiliating accident. She needed a miracle, a Christmas miracle, to escape her fate.

Inside her bladder she could hear the splashes of urine screaming LET ME OUT!

"I'm going insane!", she whispered.

At some point she had to stop and pause. Leaned against a dark wall she tried her best not to explode. People were walking past her but nobody noticed the squirming woman hidden in the shadows.

&&

Her knees were shaking, her thighs were burning, the woman was in pain with nowhere to go. What was she supposed to do now? Give up? Wet herself infront of people? Everyone was so busy with themselves that they wouldn’t even have noticed Tilly’s unfortunate accident anyway. Still, she didn’t like the idea of peeing herself. She was a grown up woman, and grown up women don’t pee themselves. This thought, as bizzare as it was, gave Tilly the strenght and determination back that she needed to keep on fighting against her own body.

“Not tonight!”, she said and got going. Her brain however began to lose it’s sanity. Tilly was running around the snowy town like a lost child. Her sight got blurry, her head started to ache. The situation was overwhelming. All she was doing now was run around until she would inevitably piss her pants. It wasn’t a question of “if” anymore but rather “when” it was going to happen… unless of course she could find somewhere safe to pee.

People began to stare at her. Tilly’s desperation was obvious, and she didn’t even try to hide it anymore.

&&

Suddenly another spasm and a short gush of warm piss was running down her legs again. The woman of course noticed but forced herself to ignore it. It was so cold outside that it almost felt as if the patch of urine was freezing her vagina shut.

Moans and groans were coming out of the desperate woman’s mouth. Passerbys were looking after her, wondering what was plaguing the woman. Tilly barely noticed any of it, in fact, she was so overwhelmed by pain and panic that she didn’t even notice how she was slowly moving towards the opposite direction of her actual home.

Once realization hit, she found herself at the outskirts of town, in a small neighborhood she barely knew. Four houses at most were surrounding the woman. Inside of them warm lights were shining. Tilly now had finally enough of this unbearable suffering, she had to go from door to door and ask for permission to go inside for a much needed piss. Oh, how embarassing. How would the people react once they would open their doors and see an adult pee pee dancing on their porch?

&&

She was already turning red just by imagining it, and she was about to run back to the crowded center but the thought of sitting on a warm toilet bowl, safe and sound, letting her liquids run free in delight was worth the embarassment.

Tilly went over to the first house, the closest one, barely able to walk. Her heart was pounding as she got closer to the nicely decorated entrance. Insecure she looked around before ringing the bell and as her eyes fell onto the snow covered frontyard, she noticed something in the corner. It was a snowman. Strongly build out of two big balls. No broom in it’s hand nor a hat on it’s head. Just a crooked carrot nose, a thin twig for a smile and two rocks as eyes and four as buttons on its belly. The snowy figure was staring at the woman as if it were to say: “Nice to see you, here I am!”

&&

And Tilly stomped over to the snowman, holding back the flood with the last bit of her remaining strenght.

&&

Behind the figure’s back she pulled her pants down for the second time that night and as the cold air chewed on her exposed genitals she opend the gates. A warm gush of piss poured untamed all over the frozen ground. The splashes got swallowed by the snow but were still to be heard in the silence of the neighborhood.

&&

“Mmmmmmmhhh”, Tilly moaned with her lips sealed. Relief at last! … And it felt good.

The fountain was strong, and so was it’s smell. The Christmas lights of the house made her urine sparkle in the darkness of the evening. Tilly was facing the back of the snowman and kept looking over it’s shoulder towards the warmly lit window. She begged for noone to look out, the man of snow was broad, but not enough to cover Tilly’s wide hips.

&&

She continued to pee as if the garden was hers. The stream sounded happy but that was just Tilly. A smile appeared on the woman’s face, satisfaction and relief. She made it somehow without wetting her pants, except a little patch between her legs.

As the last bit of dribble came to an end she quickly got dressed and covered the evidence by shoveling away the pee stained snow and footprints with her feet. Tilly ran away delighted and jumped around like a happy child feeling lighter than ever. Her destination was now her house. There were cookies to be made!

I hope this was worth the wait. Let me know what you think 🙂
