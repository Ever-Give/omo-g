I want to write a story about a tomboy who likes pee and desperation. Can I please get some suggestions on what it should be like? Guidelines are as follows:

1. No scat

2. It has to be not only erotic, but also romantic

3. Use the tags to help formulate your suggestions.

You know what? Screw it. I'm going to write this one myself...
