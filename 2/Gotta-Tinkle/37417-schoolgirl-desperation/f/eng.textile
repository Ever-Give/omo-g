This is a true story. It happened when I was in 3rd grade I think.

There was this girl in my class named Morgan. She had light brown curly hair. It was recess, I think, and she needed to use the bathroom. She went to ask the teacher, but she was busy talking to another teacher, and told her to wait. She must've had to go really bad, because she was squirming with her legs crossed I think. Some of my classmates (including me) saw her desperation, and got up from whatever they were doing and formed a circle around her, saying: "Water, water, water," over and over again. To make it even more exciting, some students had water bottles, and held them out in front of her, she kept saying: "Stop. stop. stop!" We didn't stop. eventually, the teacher finished talking, and Morgan asked if she could go. The teacher told her to go, and she ran off for the ladies room.
