Just out of curiosity, why does this post have a downvote?

While it may have been more appropriate for the original poster to stick his comment in the "Story Request" thread than to create a new topic, I don't see any reason to downvote this instead of just giving him/her a polite reminder that a thread for this kind of thing already exists.

Request Topic Link:

As a side note this, or a very similar thread, used to be stickied at the top of the Fiction/Fanfiction forum. I'm not entirely sure if this is something that just happened with the latest update, but I don't see stickied threads anymore.

I seem to recall there also used to be a Forum Rules/Conventions thread that also used to be stickied near the top.

I didn't even see it on the first page of the site. Sorry if this was annoying anyone but I'll try post in that thread from now.
