This is a story about a tomboy who loves pee and desperation. Her name is Tracy Prancer. She is a very friendly and kind exhibitionist who is very talented in gymnastics. Her closest friend happens to be a shy boy named George Lee. The two met each other in middle school, and they've been on good terms throughout high school.

However, another girl seems to have a crush on George: a would-be bully known as Valentine Hailey. In the school's art club, she was notorious for giving perverts her signature glitter torture, where she would expose their bare bottoms, sprinkle glitter on them, and spank them.

So, Hailey takes the initiative with George, and Tracy notices the commotion between the two. So, she gets wet and intervenes. Then things get interesting. Stay tuned.
