Ao3 Summary: Luz and Amity decide to have their wedding on the beautiful Fishers Island. It's normally a 3 hour roadtrip from Gravesfield under ideal conditions. Willow and Hunter decide to go on a roadtrip together to attend the wedding. Things don't go according to plan.

Disclaimer: I usually write female omorashi fics. This fic will mainly focus on male (Hunter) and a bit of female (Willow) omorashi.

A/N: In this modern AU, Hunter and Willow are not dating. The reason why they're not is explained in the story. I usually write canon compliant stories, but this fic is full of divergent headcanons cause it's based off of real life events, so I needed to impose some divergent headcanons to make it work lol. Hopefully it's not too divergent and you're still able to follow along. I've seen other fanfic authors use similar headcanons, so if you're an avid reader of TOH fanfics, some of these headcanons might be familiar.

Chapter 1: Traffic Ahead "Willow should be here any minute now," Hunter thought. "She said she'd pick me up at around 14:30. It is now 14:32."

Hunter continued to pace his room. "What if something happened to her? No, stop worrying, she's probably just delayed by traffic."

The house was quiet because Luz, Vee and Camila already left for Fishers Island earlier in the day to help setup for the wedding. The island was beautiful which is why Luz and Amity chose it as their wedding venue. They all knew that going from Gravesfield to Fishers Island would mean driving across Connecticut for a substantial amount of time. Which is why they all left early.

Too early for Hunter's liking. Hunter was happy for Luz and Amity, he was excited to celebrate their wedding, but he wasn't an early bird, he wasn't going to wake up at 6:00 for them, and neither was Willow. Which is why they agreed to head over together later. The wedding doesn't start till tomorrow anyways.

Hunter checked his phone again, despite the fact that he knew she wouldn't text him while driving. Willow was a safe driver, most of the time... "Still nothing," Hunter thought with a bit of anxiety.

He took a sip of water to calm his nerves as he looked out the window again. Just as he was about to look away, he saw Willow's car. "She's here!" Hunter thought as he bolted to the front door.

He opened the door and excitedly waved to Willow. She was looking as beautiful as ever.

Willow spedwalked up to the front door and before Hunter could say "Hey Captain!", Willow started speaking urgently with, "Hey Hunter, can I use your bathroom real quick?" Willow rubbed her legs together towards the end of her question.

"For sure Captain!" Hunter replied as he pointed her towards the direction of the ground floor bathroom.

Willow quickly walked to the bathroom and closed the door. It was about 10 m away from the front door, which Hunter thought would've been out of earshot for him. But just seconds after he heard the door close, he heard her stream hitting the toilet bowl. "Wow, Willow really had to pee, huh?" Hunter thought. He felt his member stiffen a little and decided it was a good idea to also empty his bladder before their long road trip.

"She must've had a lot of tea before she left. Unless she just didn't use the bathroom before she left." Hunter thought as he was using his ensuite to empty his own bladder. "She only lives an hour away, and she's usually able to hold it for longer without problem. After all, we watched the entire Barbie movie together and she didn't go until after we got back to my place."

"Maybe she also drank a lot of water on the way here? After all, it's a hot day and her car's AC is probably still broken..."

After Hunter finished his business, he washed his hands and drank another few gulps of water after being reminded that he would be in an oven for the next 2 hours.

When Hunter walked back up to the ground floor, Willow was still in the bathroom, but he couldn't hear her stream anymore. Their bladders would both be pretty much empty soon. He wondered how quickly their bladders would fill up during their roadtrip. If they filled at the same rate, then he'd know roughly how badly Willow needed to pee based on his own bladder. That was unlikely though, Hunter knows that he usually drinks water at a faster rate than Willow does. Then again, being taller, his bladder would be naturally larger than hers. He stopped his train of thought as he saw Willow walk out of the bathroom.

"Ready to leave?" Willow asked.

"Yeah, I just need some help getting my stuff to your car," Hunter replied.

Willow proceeded to carry most of Hunter's things to her car. Hunter stood there blushing for a few seconds admiring her muscular arms before taking his backpack and going into Willow's car himself.

"It's roadtrippin' time!" Hunter excitedly exclaimed.

Willow giggled. "Here's my phone, you can control the music as I drive." Willow stated. Hunter was happy to add his favourite classical and film soundtracks to the Spotify Now Playing queue. There weren't many friends in their generation that liked that genre of music. But he was glad that Willow liked the same types of music that he did too.

Willow pulled out of the driveway and the roadtrip officially began.

"I'm glad they're finally getting married. It's about time." Hunter stated.

"Yeah, both of them keep coming to me about wedding advice, what they should wear, and how to best impress the other on the day. Like I know anything about that." Willow said with some sarcasm at the end.

Hunter chuckled at her comment. He wished he was in a relationship as wholesome as what Luz and Amity have. He still remembers that day a year and a half ago when he confessed his feelings for Willow, only for her to tell him that she was aromantic. She's never felt any romantic attraction towards anyone before. But luckily, that didn't end their close friendship. Hunter felt lucky to have such a great friend like Willow and that their friendship didn't end on awkward terms that day. Still, he wished he didn't feel these feelings towards her anymore. He tried using dating apps to find other girls to get his mind off of her, but uni and exams kept him too busy to establish and pursue long term relationships. Plus, they just shared so many common interests and got along so well that it was difficult for him to imagine finding happiness in getting together with another girl. But, he'll get over her eventually... right?

As Hunter got lost in his thoughts, they approached the highway. "Alright, gotta close the windows now. Sorry that my AC is still broken. There's some ice water in the cooler in the backseat to help you stay cool."

Hunter nodded and closed his window. It was nice to feel the breeze in his hair, but now he'll have to suffer in this oven for the next 2 hours.

Shortly after, he took two bottles from the cooler in the back and drank from one. He kept it close to his body to help himself cool down.

"Do you also want a sip of water?" Hunter asked.

Willow nodded. "Can you unscrew the lid and help pour some down my mouth? I gotta keep both hands on the wheel after all." Willow replied.

Hunter uncapped the bottle and slowly poured some water into Willow's mouth. When she nodded that she had enough, Hunter screwed the lid back on and placed it in the cupholder.

Hunter's thoughts went back to earlier when Willow was urgently asking to use his washroom. He fantasized telling her no, making her wait, and seeing her potty dance. He would've never done that in real life, he cared way too much about Willow to put her through that torture intentionally. But being someone who was turned on by omorashi, the fantasy kept him entertained in this otherwise monotonous car ride.

Willow had to tap the brakes as they approached a stretch of highway with a bit of congestion. It wasn't a lot, but the additional g-forces that Hunter felt during this maneuver pressed on his bladder just enough that he felt a small urge to pee.

"Oh wow, already?" Hunter thought. "This roadtrip just started, we literally just passed North Canaan and I already feel a slight urge to pee. We're still quite far from the New London Ferry. I wonder if Willow feels the same?"

Hunter knew that Willow was super accommodating and would immediately seek and then pull into a rest stop if Hunter ever told her that he needed to pee. But Hunter didn't intend to ever ask her to stop. Cause secretly, he got a thrill at the idea that his own bladder was at Willow's mercy, even if she didn't know about it. He won't allow himself to pee unless Willow needs to pee too. And he typically drinks more water than Willow, so he knows he'll be testing his bladder's limits.

The heat was making Hunter parched again, so he took another sip of water.

"Could you give me a sip everytime you take a sip?" Willow asked.

Hunter nodded and proceeded to give Willow another sip of water.

"Now I have a way of controlling Willow's fluid intake... By syncing it up with mine... This is stupid," Hunter thought. "I really shouldn't be thinking about controlling my friend like this."

So he decided not to abuse this power, he'd only take a drink if he was legitimately thirsty. Though he had a feeling that over a long enough period of time, both their bladders would be carrying roughly the same amount of pee in terms of proportion vs capacity.

At around 15:00, the tiny bit of congestion they encountered turned into a traffic jam. Hunter could see the hairs of the driver in front of them and cars in every direction he looked out.

"Aw man, there must be an accident ahead. This section of highway is usually really clear." Willow stated.

They were moving at a snail's place. Hunter has noticed that Willow tends to be a bit aggressive in stop and go traffic. She likes to step on the gas harder than she needs to, and then slam the brakes just to advance a yard (A/N: As a Canadian writing about a roadtrip that takes place in Connecticut, I vomited while begrudgingly writing down an appropriate length in imperial units). That maneuver contributes a lot more g-forces than Hunter thought would be appropriate to cover such a small distance. "I thought Willow was a safe driver, but I guess she gets a bit antsy and wants some entertainment when she's frustratingly stuck in stop and go traffic," Hunter thought.

During one of these "distance bursts", Willow stepped on the gas a little too hard, and so had to slam on the brakes even harder to prevent herself from crashing into the car just inches in front of her. This jostled Hunter's bladder and made him realize just how quickly it was filling up.

"C-," Hunter tried to say. He took a sip of water and offered Willow the same. She happily took the sip. Clearly, she was just as thirsty as he was. "Can I open a window? It's so hot in here and we're not even moving that quickly." Hunter said.

Willow nodded and proceeded to open all of the car's windows. Hunter felt immediate bliss as the cool breeze hit his skin. It was enough to make him shiver a bit and he felt it in his bladder, but he also enjoyed that feeling. He looked over at Willow to see if he could spot any sign of desperation. But she looked super focused, her eyes locked onto the road waiting for the next yard long gap between her car and the one in front. "She must take joy in doing that distance burst maneuver," Hunter thought.

Hunter brought his legs together as his bladder continued to fill. It was now more comfortable to not manspread. He kept his head still, facing forward, but quickly moved his eyes to glance over at Willow's legs. He could've sworn he saw her shaking them. Or it could've just been his eyes moving too quickly. It was hard to tell, but Hunter didn't want to be caught staring at Willow's legs.

At 16:00, the traffic finally began to clear. Willow was no longer doing her distance burst maneuvers cause it was no longer safe to do so. Hunter would argue it was never safe to do so, but he's not in the driver's seat so who was he to say anything about it. They still weren't in the clear though. Now, they were moving at a speed you'd expect to move at in a residential area. Far off from highway speed, but still better than the snail's pace they were in a few minutes ago. Hunter began to subtly rub his legs together. All that water he drank was catching up to him.

They were now driving fast enough that it was best to close the windows again. The heat returning made Hunter drink several more sips. He offered water to Willow and she only drank a small sip this time. "Hmm, seems like she's starting to reduce her fluid intake." Hunter thought.

A few minutes later, Hunter took a few more sips of water. "It's ok, I'm good for now." Willow said, before Hunter offered her some more water. Hunter shrugged and put the water away.

Now Hunter was questioning whether he should continue to stay hydrated, or bare the dry mouth so that he could slow down the rate at which his bladder was filling. And it was filling fast. At this point, Hunter was paying attention to all the road signs, looking to see if any of them indicated an upcoming service plaza. He didn't like using gas station bathrooms, and judging by the fact that Willow just passed a sign that said "gas station", he's willing to bet Willow hates them too. He doesn't have any conclusive evidence that Willow needs to pee now. But he feels like after seeing her legs possibly figet around and her refusal to drink more water despite how hot it was, he could infer that she had to go, at least a little. It's been a while since they left home and they both stayed fairly hydrated the entire time.

"She did have to go pretty badly in the hour it took her to get to my place, so maybe she had some caffeine this morning," Hunter thought. "She's gonna pull over to a service plaza any second now and I'll have a chance to pee."

It was 16:30 and they still hadn't seen any service plaza signs yet. Hunter was starting to worry. "What if she doesn't even need to pee. What if she just skips over the next service plaza sign. Would I be able to hold it until the next one after that?" Every second that passed, it got more and more tempting to ask to pull over to the next gas station, like the one she had just passed. But Hunter was also a bit turned on that Willow was unintentionally denying him from peeing.

At 16:45, Hunter spotted a "Service Plaza 10 mi" sign. He was secretly hoping that Willow would skip over it. He was good at holding his pee. He could probably hold it until the next one after that, right?

"I'm gonna stop at the next rest stop for some gas, do you need anything?" Willow asked Hunter.

"A bathroom would be nice. I kinda have to pee." Hunter replied.

"Same, been holding it for a while now." Willow responded.

"So she does need to pee!" Hunter thought. He glanced over at her to see if he could catch any signs of desperation. But Willow was good at staying composed. He couldn't find any signs that she needed to pee except for the fact that she just told him.

Hunter squeezed his legs together in anticipation of the approaching rest stop. He's gonna be able to empty his bladder soon.

Hunter was hoping that Willow would get some gas first, but to his surprise, she parked right outside the main plaza building instead of by the gas pumps.

The two walked out of the car and went into the service plaza. They were both disappointed to find out that there was a line for both the men's and the women's bathrooms. The women's was a lot longer and almost stretched all the way outside the building.

Hunter squeezed his legs at the sight. Though the men's line wasn't that long, he knew he'd be able to pee soon, he felt a bit sorry for Willow cause he knew she'd be waiting a while.

"All these people must've been stuck in the same traffic jam that we were," Hunter stated.

Willow nodded, but otherwise stayed quiet.

"Do you want me to keep you company while you wait?" Hunter asked, not aware that he was slightly doubled over and squeezing his legs together.

Willow noticed Hunter's desperation and replied. "No it's ok, no point in having both of us suffer. Go do your business and I'll meet you outside."

Hunter nodded and proceeded to join the men's line. As he predicted, it was moving pretty quickly. That didn't stop him from doing the occasional leg crosses and bending over a bit. He was nearing his limit after all.

He finally entered the bathroom, but waited for a stall to open instead of using the urinals. He wanted to enjoy the sensation of his full bladder just a tiny bit longer. The sound of all the pee streams wasn't helping. He doubled over and grabbed his crotch as a wave of desperation caught him off guard. A stall opened up and Hunter walked inside and locked the door.

He pulled down his pants and boxers and just stood there with his penis pointed towards the toilet bowl. He stood up straight with his legs spread apart. This was the position that made it the most difficult to hold his pee. He fought his body's natural tendency to squeeze his legs together and to double over, or to simply relax his spincter.

He liked the sensation of his pee being forced to leave his body despite his own willpower keeping his sphincter closed rather than choose the boring route and voluntarily opening his spincter. He felt tremendous pressure from his bladder pushing on his poor weakened spincter. It would give in any second now.

He started rubbing his lower abdomen and felt a wave of desperation at the same time he touched his rock hard bladder bulge. He gently moved his hand around the contours of his bladder, causing even more tension for his poor, overworked spincter.

Then came the pulses. His urethra started twitching as a bit of pee started to bypass his barely closed spincter. He started leaking a bit into the toilet. He imagined that Willow had to pee just as badly as he did right now, except she didn't have the luxury of standing right next to a toilet. He imagined her doing a potty dance in line fighting every sensation to pee that he was currently forcing his body to endure right now. He knew that Willow would never let her own desperation get to this point, but he just couldn't help but fantasize about that scenario at the moment.

When his leaks turned into steady, uncontrollable spurts, Hunter decided he had enough. He didn't want his crotch to be too stained with dried urine, they still had a ways to go with their roadtrip after all. He released his stream and he felt blissful relief.

He let his muscles relax as his urine continued to shoot out of him. He never got tired of this feeling. All good things come to an end though, and his stream eventually slowed down, then stopped. He shook three times, then used some toilet paper to clean up the areas around his crotch and legs where his uncontrolled spurts hit earlier. He washed his hands, then walked out of the bathroom.

The women's line was still quite long by the time Hunter walked out. Hunter was only able to sneak a quick glance at Willow before she noticed him and composed herself. But the cute image of what he saw would replay in his mind for the next little while. He saw Willow doubled over with her legs crossed. Her hand was jammed to her crotch. And when she noticed Hunter, her face turned red as she composed herself, standing straight as if she wasn't holding back a massive flood right now.

Willow looked slightly away from Hunter, as if embarrassed that he had to see her like this. "Imma grab a sandwich," Hunter said as he passed her. Willow nodded, her face had a slight grimace of discomfort. She continued to hold her pee in silence.

Hunter went to the convenience store within the service plaza to grab himself a sandwich while he waited for Willow. As he waited for his sandwich, he glanced over at Willow and saw her shifting her weight back and forth. He did feel sorry for her. She clearly has to pee quite badly if she's already resorted to holding herself and doing a mild potty dance. Even if she's able to put up a front to save face when Hunter's around, he knew that Willow was probably nearing her limit. He hoped that his friend could make it to a toilet in time.

As Hunter was munching on his sandwich, Willow was finally inside the women's room and out of sight. That was good, it meant Willow was close to the toilet now. Hunter checked the time. It was a bit before 17:00.

After he finished his sandwich, Willow finally came out. "That was a close call, I almost didn't make it," she admitted to him. Hunter blushed slightly at Willow's comment. It replayed her cute potty dance in his mind.

Hunter slapped himself mentally and brought himself back to the real world. "Well, I'm glad you made it. Let's grab some gas and hit the road now." Hunter replied.

A/N: Thank you mourn365 for beta reading this fic!

The relationship between Hunter and Willow I wrote here is partially based off of my own experience with my friend, and inspired by this short (non-omo) fanfic I read a year and a half ago: "Unrequited (But Not Unloved)" by newwwwusername [https://archiveofourown.org/works/39404319]

I know it's not canonical, but that's the context I want my readers to be aware of going forward for this and my (possible) future Huntlow fics.
