It was a cloudless afternoon, as Yukon shivered at the bus stop. He adjusted his facemask with his three-fingered hand, making sure his nose wasn't crooked. Yellow irises hid behind green contact lenses. Annoyed with the weather, he fidgeted with his trench coat, and glanced at his watch. Five minutes late. Grumbling, he scanned his environment; a tall city surrounded the nearly seven foot “man”.

“Moderately intelligent,” he thought to himself, now glancing at the stoic city citizens, “Though on my planet, out buses aren’t late.”

As soon as he thought of it, a bus started to shake and stop. It opened its doors with a loud clang. Stepping inside, and giving money to the driver, he instantaneously encountered a problem. Nearly every seat was full. However, that wasn’t the main issue. The thing was, the bus was full of furries. Every last human was in costume. He fearfully tucked in his lips, as he started shambling to the last open seat. His brain churned with why there were so many of them.

Getting situated in his seat, he felt the bus chug and grind down the street. He was about to ask his seatmate why he was there, when he noticed something odd. While everyone else was sitting still, the person to the left of him was wiggling. Assuming that the human was a male, he crossed his legs, and stuck his hands in his groin. Small grunts of effort could be heard periodically. He wore a plaid shirt with jeans, and donned a skull head that had black fur. A black bookbag attempted to make a wall between them.

Scratching the side of his face, he asked, “Need any assistance?”

“If you have a water bottle, that’d be nice,” he joked.

Unfortunately, understanding jokes was not something that Yukon did.

“I do not have those. My apologies,” he explained.

Putting his hands on the seats, he stated, “No, no, you’re cool.”

A sense silence rose between the wiggling furry, and the giant “man”. Feeling he didn’t make a great first impression, he stuck out his hand for the other to shake, human-style.

“Hello!” he greeted. “My name is Yukon. What’s yours?”

“What happened to your hand?”

Sweat dripped down the back of his neck.

“What do you mean?” he asked attempting to root out the nervousness in his voice.

The skull-human showed him his own hand, which had five, long, skinny fingers.

“Ah. Well, um,” he muttered, trying to find an excuse, “I had an accident.”

With a chuckle, he stated jokingly, “I’m about to have one right now.”

As soon as he said that, he realized that it wasn’t funny at all, and only made the atmosphere worse. Sulking, the furry stared out the window, wiggling his hips. Yukon wondered what he meant by accident.

“You didn’t tell me your name,” he stated, trying not to sound like a predator.

“Oh,” he quietly spoke, “Erin.”

A silence yet again drifted between them.

Hoping he wasn’t too annoying, Yukon asked, “Why are you wiggling so much?”

Trying to hide his annoyance, Erin responded, “Well, I live in the country out East, so I’ve never been to a big city. I’ve been on this damn bus for… Err, what time is it?”

“Nine o’ clock,” he reported.

“Four fucking hours!” he hissed.

Gripping himself, he groaned, “I’m going to explode.”

“Explode?!” Yukon thought, eyes wide open.
