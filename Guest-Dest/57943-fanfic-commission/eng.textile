Hi guys! Well, I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this topic (if it's not, I'm sorry, I can change it's place if necessary).

Anyway; I have seen quite talented writers here in the forum, and I would like to commission someone to write a fanfiction (omorashi, of course). I would prefere if the person is a Frozen fan, since it's the story I want the fanfic to be about, but if you are someone who don't really know a lot about Frozen, but is ok with doing some research to understand the universe and the characters personality, it's also fine!

I think that's it. If you have questions, you can ask here (it can be useful, because someone else might have the same question you do). If you want to discuss theme, price and deadline, you can please PM me! Also, if you have already published any stories here, it would be nice if you could give me the link so I can know more about your work! ^^
