This is the rework version.it will switch between 1st&3rd person perspective and more content planned. It will probably be made a comic too but way later.

Chapter 1: I got a magic power

While I walk home from school. Passing a alley where a lot of girls use as an emergency reliving spot.

How did I know? The day I found out about this, my usual path was closed for maintenance. So I have to walk this path,

Where I see a girl from the same school reliving herself, look up to see me and run away. I choose this path every day since and found that this is the perfect place for peeing. One way alley surrounded with unoccupied buildings.

This time, I see a girl with unusual clothing. She wear a long white dress. A cosplayer? No, there's no events around here. She walked funny and have hands between her legs. She clearly have to pee very bad. I followed her to the alley hiding from her sight. She wiggle around with desperation, look left and right to see if there's anyone nearby, and start pulling her underwear down with shaking hand.

Perfect time to strike, just as she thought she was going to be relieved. I casuallu walk out of the shadow and look at her, pretend to be surprised.

"Ah, I'm sorry!" and walk away

"Hey! You're misunderstanding! I'm not doing anything! I just see a cat and followed it!" She followed me trying to explain herself, She has fallen for my trap

"It's okay, I understand, there's no toilet nearby" I stalled

She keep following and trying to convince me for a while, Until she stopped, her bladder has reached its limit. She falls down and start wetting herself with red face and tears in her eyes.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry" I approach her.

She kept peeing until she can control her bladder again.

"Please don't tell anyone about this" and give me a silver ring before flying away. Huh? Did she just fly? I got left with a ring as a bribe and confusion.

But that's a good experience seeing a girl being very desperate and pee herself.

Anyway I got home, take off my shoes and jacket, sit on the couch and try on the ring, I was greated by my younger sister asking about the ring I am wearing. I told her I bought it from some random accessories shop and give her a cup of pudding she liked lately. She smiled and go eat it on the table.

I go up to my room, put my bagpack on the floor and open my pc. Start a new campaign mode of a MMORPG with my friend. My friend plays as paladin while I play as mage, since I already cleared as a knight.

The basic tutorial for casting spells is just like your typical isekai anime where you imagine stuff and it becomes true. A pretty mage NPC is teaching me how to cast a spell, I just go with the flow.

"Close your eyes, Breathe in deeply. Imagine water start collecting in the air into a ball then open your eyes" I know I can just press E when she stops talking to cast a spell but I did it anyway.

To my surprise there's a literal ball of water floating between my face and the screen. I panicked but able to flick my keyboard away before the water ball make it wet.

"Holy shit I can cast spells!" I shout with surprise.

"Of course stupid, you're a mage" my friend replied.

Bonus: Test out new found power

After I finished playing. I go down to take a bath. I got into the bathroom to see my younger sister in front of me, topless with a panties. Of course I don't get arouse by my own sister so I just tell her "mom make pasta for dinner" and went to bath.

I use fire magic to heat up the water and warm air to dry my hair, just discovering convenient of magic.

Then I got an idea, how about I use this power to enjoy my fetish? I put on my clothes and come join the dinner with my family. I wanted to test my magic on someone. My mom and dad is out of the question, so i choose my sister. First I try warming up her hand to find if it effects human, And it does. So I try to fill her bladder up, but there's a problem. If I blindly put liquid in he abdomen without knowing where's the bladder it might be very bad if I fill up the wrong organ.

Should I just play safe and fill her mouth with water? No, that's too obvious. After a while I figured out if I can't see the the bladder, why don't just give myself an x-ray vision. So I did

(of course it's not literally x-ray since x-ray barely see the structure of the bladder so imagine it as the bladder got "highlighted" and can be see like a normal object through the body)

I look at my sister's bladder. It's still almost empty since she just took a bath. I try creating water inside it but I can't just violate 1st law of thermodynamic, I can't just create matter. So I slowly transfer water from a bottle to her bladder. I filled it to like 50%(I don't know cause the bladder volume is not absolute) she's still acting normal, so I press on. The bottle is empty, I can now tell that there's at least 500ml of water in her bladder. She starts acting restless but still on her seat. Her bladder is surely at around 80%.

I gonna keep filling her bladder until she can't endure the urge anymore.

She stand up "I need to go to the bathroom". Shame, her bladder still isn't full yet but she's going out of my sight. As last wave I put more into her bladder.

"MOM! I CAN'T OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR" my sister shouted.

I remembered I closed the door without unlocking so the door just lock with no one inside. I rushed to her knowing that last wave might make her wet herself. I see her bladder filled with water and her hand gripping her urethra. I'd admit it was arousing

I act like I'm fixing the lock for half a minute then unlock it with magic. She shove me to the side, rushed in and take off her pants. After a while I hear her sights followed by noise of urine hissing out her bladder

Chapter 2: testing out

@@in the next morning. I came to school early ,buy a big bottle of water and sit on the bench next to the field's bathroom. I wave at my friend who's playing baseball, and use watching him play as a reason why I'm here. While looking for some girls to tease.

I found a girl with straigth brown hair drinking a can of orange soda with bladder at around 70%. She is talking with her friends and act very normal.

I start transferring water into her bladder until her posture changed at 95% she started moving around while talking.

At 100% she clearly very desperate and excuses herself to the bathroom.

@@as she run pass me I fill her bladder up to 120%. But that's seems to be way too much. She stops moving falls the the ground and grips her crotch. I quickly pull the water back before she lose control. then she sprints to the bathroom while leaking a little. She came out patting her bladder with relief.

Next, in the Math class at 10:30 am. I see Sarah, a girl next to me. sitting next to me with a full bladder. She is a good student and shy girl. I know she never ask to go to the bathroom before, but she's really pushing her limit here, 99% with 30 whole minutes to go. This is not an omo fiction with "full bladder" from day to night. Her bladder couldn't possibly endure that much pee.

I ask her "do you have to use the bathroom really bad or something? you're shaking too much"

"N-No! I'm just...cold..." nice job, this is in the middle of April. Her decision is already getting stale.

After a while, I don't know how much exactly but her bladder is stretching very bad. She finally admitted she have to pee and ask me to help. I have an idea and tell her to massage her bladder in a circle.

"Isn't that will just put more pressure into my- you know? Bladder...". Yes it does, but I convince her to try.

Finally, with desperation she start lightly rub her hand on her bladder. I cast heal on her bladder and reduce the pain of her bladder wall being stretched. Though the urge still present intensely. I could tell from her face that if it wasn't for 40 people in this room she'll absolutely let lose here and now.

After 15 minutes. she can't write a single word on her note, lay on her desk, holding her urine in tears. I saw a leak with x-ray vision, it's not just the urge gets the better of her. It's literally the pressure of her internal organ pushing against the bladder. Her white panties dampen with concentrated urine. She shudder with every drop leaked.

I start the feel pity so I help her by slowly relieving her bladder into my water bottle until the class ends. Then she barely walk to the bathroom.

End

The changes will happen in the chapter 3 it's not just going to be a slice of life with pee magic

Chapter 3: assassin from another world

@@in the afternoon, I was enjoy thinking about my next experiment. Until a knife came flying my way and almost hit me in the back.

"Is this a revenge from some girl?" I thought to myself, Before I got cut off by the second knife, this time it was aim to my head. I turned to the source of the incoming projectiles to see a person in hood.

With 2 knives throwing my way I assume this person is coming for my head. I stalled out into the open field where there's no people to possibly get caught in the crossfire. While running I inspect the assassin for more information but the assassin's hood interfere with my inspection magic.

As soon as I got out into the open, the assassin leap at me with knives on both hands. I panicked and gush a burst of wind at them... or her. The hood flipped open, revealing a black hair girl... Wait, is that... animal ears? Probably see me distracted, She leaps at me again.

I'm no sword master so I just cover myself with barrier, But it shattered. Taken aback I force her body to not move. But after some time she override my magic and go straight for my neck, I doged it. In panic I shouted

"What do you want from me!? We can talk!"

"You're not worthy of the ring, give it to me" that gave me such a strong bad guy vibes

"Even if I give it to you, you're still gonna kill to silence me anyway aren't you?"

"Tch"

With that, I concluded giving her the ring is not a good option. I cover myself with an earth dome to buy some time while I think about a way to stop her.

I can't stop her with effect magic since she can override it. I'm not prepared to kill a person, so fire and lightning are out. A burst of wind can effect her though. I figure a sudden wave of matter can effect her. Then I heard a voice from the outside.

"Coward! Get out and fight like a man!"

"If I get out I would be dead like a fool, I'd rather be a Coward"

"You'll regret this"

Then she starts speaking gibberish. Am I that annoying she gives up speaking English? Wait, is she chanting spells?

Whatever that spell is, I'm not willing to take it. I remove my earth dome and splash a water ball on her, hoping to disrupt her chanting but failed. Then I got an idea

Before she could release whatever she's casting, I turn on my x-ray vision and flooded her bladder with every molecule of water available near me. Filling it to full on bursting within seconds

"Huh... hey, hey, what's happening. A! Ahhh"

@@she slowly lose her balance and fall on the ground. Overloaded, her bladder lost control and wet herself on the spot. Humiliated, she threatened me.

"You're going to pay once I finished"

"No You're not"

"What?"

I create a magic circle on the ground that teleport pee and water that's touching the ground back into her bladder. the puddle on the ground dissapear, then appear back at the base of her bladder, filling it back up. She became an endless water fall for a few minutes.

"You're gonna- haaanhg!"

"Stop it- Ahh!"

"I can't- a- take it... anymore"

"Stop!"

"Please!"

"Ahhnngh"

"I'm Sorry! I'm sorry!"

"I- I'll do anything! Stop it PLEASE!"

Her way of talking become more of a victim now.

"Answer my questions"

"Yes!"

"Who are you, where are you from, how did you got here, why do you want the ring, why can't I put a spell on you, which type of animals are you, what is this ring---"

"STOPPP- that's too much questions! My tummy hurts! Stop it first! Please!"

I cancel my spells and watch her bladder deflate back into a little pouch in her pelvis. She's sitting in a big puddle of water and pee.

"Now Answer me"

"Grouwlrs- hhg"

She shudder after I fill her bladder right back up.

"I- I'm Julia doldora. I- I'm from the other side. I crossed the ruin gate to here. I- I need the ring to get home and- and" shudder

Julia: I'm going to burst..

"Continue"

Julia: Trust me, I'm sorry, I mean no harm... I- I just want to get home

"You were going to kill me, now Answer why won't my magic work on you"

Julia: Maybe it's because I have more intelligent that you- ahhh! I- I don't mean that way I- I mean the stats of your ring

"stats?"

Julia: yes, m- my cloak has magic resistance. And I belive I'm close to a cats so please let me pee!

"go on"

Julia: Ehh!?

Julia's bladder reaches its limit and she wets herself once again.

Julia: ahhh... such a mess...

Chapter 4: the otherside

Julia is now in such a mess basically everything below her waist is covered in urine. I have no intention walking around with pee drenched weirdly dress girl and become a topic at school. I shove her pee puddle into the ground soil.

"Take of your wet clothes" I can do it while they're still on but I'm more interested in bare pussy than using x-ray vision to see...

Julia: eh!? can't you just dry it while I'm wearing?

"Are you suggesting I dry your internal organ along with it?" extreme consequence to make her cut the choice

Julia: I'd rather not... but! I don't wanna undress... her pee still drip down the crotch of her shorts

"I don't wanna go around with a pee drenched girl"

Julia: I guess... just hear me

Julia proceed to tell me about the conflict on the other side, she doesn't know very much but apparently her village got attack by a demon army like a stereotypical isekai anime

@@after being Informed about the other side. I got carried away by my imagination. Dungeon looting, magic academy, Adventure, What might I Find in a World of magic and fantasy.

Julia: Waves, Hello...Hello? Are you listening?

@@her ear point my way and her tail tail wag around in impulse, With 3 Years experience of have a Cat. I guess she's curious about me.

"I am, I am, what about it?"

Julia: since you're soo good at magic, how about you come and help as a same demon opposing species?

@@all thing considered, I'd rather not use my day on that, I can't just ditch school and I just wanna chill in the weekend... though I wanna check something out. Maybe just a little peek.

"I don't promise but show me the way"

Julia: why can't you? The world need you and you just gonna do nothing?

"can you stay here for 10 year after I helped defeat the army?"

Julia: I don't wanna...

"Well I don't wanna get dragged into another world either, I can help but I'm not going to be your hero"

Julia: but... sigh I understand...

"Where's the portal?"

Julia: it's not a portal! It's a ruin gate. It can't just be cross in and out like a door! That's why I asked you to open it!

"You mean trying to kill me and use my ring?"

Julia: I'm sorry... the gate is this way...

Julia lead me into the depth of forest near my school. I've never knew it's this deep or it's just the ruin gate or whatever hiding it. I can't manage to get a sense of direction in this area. However Julia seems to be good at this.

I let her lead until we arrive at stone structure resemble a portal frame on a foundation.

"How do I turn it on exactly?"

Julia: just supply your mana to it

"TF you mean supply mana"

Julia: um... uhhh. it can't really be explain with word on this side's language... just try, your imagination already strong enough I think

"You don't speak English? What should I imagine?"

Julia: the gate just kinda temporary give you ability to understand the language while in the other side... How about something flow in you flow into the gate?

With that I just imagine a stereotypical fluid-like mana flow into the frame of the portal, power up each ruin. To my surprise it actually work really well. Turn out my imagination can just make up things

Julia look at the portal with sparkly eyes

Julia: Let's go!

It's 16:21 pm, I don't have problem taking a walking in the world of fantasy for couple hours.

"Sure"

Both of us crossed the gate, I was met with noon sun and green forest

"You know a way to your village right?"

Julia: of course! Why won't I

"how far is it?"

Julia: about 20 minutes ish maybe

I follow Julia along the path, looking at sceneries. A huge thing flying by far above in the sky, abnormally tall mountain range.

"What's about it, the intelligence stats thingy"

Julia: I don't know much but stats are property of things. And if Clashes the dominant stats will win

"so I can't use magic on you cause apparently my intelligence is lower than your robe's magic resistance?"

Julia: p- please don't take offense! Intelligence is the casting authority of your equipment, n-not your actual intelligence

"okay okay, don't be so scared"

I think I'm being mean to her... But i prefer this power dynamics than getting stabbed so I'll keep acting like this until I feel comfortable enough.

I checked my ring's stats. My ring have value of intelligence are 1/7 of Julia's robe

"Do you perhaps know how much your robe's magic resistance is?"

Julia: my dad says it's seven

Good, I have intelligence in total of 1...

After a while I notice Julia's ears pointing around, I just trust my imagination and made up a search magic. I sensed a pack of canine based animal slowly split and surrounded us.

"Something's following us and it's going surround us"

Julia: huh, how'd you know?

"Magic"

Julia: we better be prepared for whatever comes

A group of wolf block our path, the rest is hiding around in every direction, probably waiting for a chance to take us by surprise. The group that confronting us seems to be old wolf using itself as bait for younger wolf to hunt.

"They surrounded us"

Julia: I know, I'll take the front

"What? Hey! Don't just leave me with the rest!?"

Without replying, Julia leaps at the old wolves in the front.

As soon as she leaves my side lot of wolf jumps out at me. I didn't quite followed the pace of all this actions so I was stunned. Just stand there surrounded by wolves

They all leap at me, probably with the intention of incapacitate and eat me alive.

I surround myself with packed earth dome and explode it out into shrapnel, then the wolf changed into taking turn jump out at me. I'm able to fend this off easily by throwing random magic at them. After things don't go along the plan. The alpha itself lunges at me.

With the fear of getting killed. I panicked and launch a stone spike at it with more mana than I should have.

It blows though the skull of the wolf and shred both itself and the wolf's head in to mist

After seeing their pack leader killed the remaining wolves flees. Julia turn back at me. I can tell from her paled face. She's horrified by the scene of me standing upon the blood and corpses. She's stunlocked for a while before asking me.

Julia: How are you going to eat that?

"You eat wolves?"

Julia: You don't?

We stare confusely at each other for a moment...

Julia: What do you eat then?

"Pork, beef, chicken or something like that"

Julia: Deer? Moose?

"If I need to... sheep, rabbit... well, a lot. But not wolves or cat"

Julia: where do you draw the line actually?

"We don't eat pets"

Julia: ok...

Julia: mumbles how are they able to surround us without me noticing...

"they followed us from afar before closing in"

Julia: huh? How they and do that without losing us

Point at her crotch "your pee"

Julia: blush wait...I smell?

"Yes"

Julia breaks eye contact and look around in embarrassment

"I don't mind"

Julia: Ha ha... we should hurry before um... something else come.

She seems to be awkward

"I can wash your pee"

Julia: watch me what!?

"wash wash, you don't wanna take off your clothes so I can run water through your clothes instead. though you'll be wet"

Julia: I- I prefer being wet than smell...

With that, I the it as a green light and start from her robe. I bunch the pee stained area together and run water through them while Julia try to keep her tail from wetting.

Next is her butt, she jerk a little when I run the water through her pants. Maybe from the cold of water. I make the water warmer. Her tail wag in a happy way. I pulled her shorts and panties back reveal a little of her butt. then I ran warm water into the inside of her shorts. The water flow pass her butt all the way to the bottom of her vulva. She jumped and turned to face me. Her face is in mix of angry and embarrassed.

"I'm just washing inside your shorts..."

Julia: enough with my back!

She's facing me. This time she have her hand grabbing the edge of her shorts, keeping me from opening it. I grab her waist and run warm water through her crotch area. She blush and move her legs together. I noticed it and figured it may be the sign of a need to pee.

I turn on my x-ray vision and to my surprise, her bladder is full. She must have been holding some of her pee in since she wet herself. I want to tease her so bad...

I match the temperature of the water with the piss inside her bladder and run it through her shorts into the fabric of her panties. I makesure to make her feels like her pussy is in a warm body of water that she can empty her bladder into whenever she wants. Her bladder sphincter relaxes, letting her pee to flow just to the tip of her urethra waiting to be let out.

Before she pees, I stop the flow and went to wash her boots by cool water. With the coldness from below, her pelvic tense up.

"Done, They shouldn't be able to smell you now"

Julia: look away T-thanks

With a full bladder and previous stimuli. She must be feeling an intense urge to pee. She acts like there's nothing and lead the way but after a while her legs squeezed together on its own. She resisted it for about a minute before giving up.

Julia: P-please wait here, I will be back

"why though"

Julia: N-nothing

Julia separate herself into the forest. I follow her Just for her to notice. She keep waking to get away but I just follow her around. She eventually reaches her limit.

Will she keep holding and wet herself or squat down despite me in proximity?

Julia take off her underwear and squats down panting. But her bladder won't relax. My present make her unable to urinate naturally. I approach her, Julia hurriedly puts her shorts and panties back on. Her bladder bulging. her body frailing and shaking. Look at me pleadly.

I back away to let her do her business. As I retreat her bladder slowly relax. I wanted to confront her again but I feel like I can't betray that eyes

After I'm somewhat far enough she start to pee. And let out a half moan half exhale noise that's unmatched by any sound I've heard

End

Chapter 5: demon invasion

While waiting for Julia to finish her business. I keep my distance to not interrupt her wonderful time peeing while still keep my sensing magic on the surrounding... well mostly her bladder emptying. I wanted go on every detail on how she water that patch of grass with her pent up urine. I'll save that for later.

She finishes her shot, puts her clothes back on and sniffed to my location. I was about to confront her about pee but she beats me to it

Julia: um, thanks for understanding...

"wdym"

I was teasing her and now she thanks me?

Julia: you know what I was doing right? If, If you didn't walk away my bladder would hurt really bad

"Aight, I know when to stop"

"Wait with the way you saying. You can't really let it out or you just try really hard to not let me see?"

Julia: blush I really can't do it while I'm nervous

"You can't bring yourself to let it out or it just doesn't come out"

Julia: latter one...

"Is this genetic?"

Julia: most of animals folks share this same traits...nod

"How about the other thing?..."

?

"P-Poop?"

Julia: frown You too? why do human always associate us with animals?

"Huh? Wait wait what? What did I say? I didn't mean anything offensive, what? I poop too!"

Julia: you do?

"you don't?"

@@again, both of us look at eachother in confusion.

"Every living organism do it over at my side"

Julia: didn't know that...

Sorry

Both of us apologize at the same time, I'm starting to question our dynamic... I'm going to stop asking about this topic.

A while later. I arrived at what Julia calls "Nora" I'm actually speaking this Julia's language right now and this confuses me. I don't know if Nora means village or this village is name Nora. She just refer to this place as Nora.

Anyway, we look into the Nora and see no citizen roaming around. Soldiers guarding in front of some buildings that I think holds people. I concluded the war is near.

Julia: they're already fighting!

"where are we going? shouldn't we either join the war or hide"

Julia: we're going to Yaha to get jamar first

"what?"

Julia: you need to wear it so they recognize you as allies.

"o-ok"

I think when a word can't be translate into English it just transliterate the word instead

We arrived at the headquarter of some sort, guess this is Yaha. Inside people start looking at me but with Julia together, they don't question much. At the front desk Julia ask about bringing me to the Frontline and request them a jamar for me.

I thought they'd say something like don't bring outsider or something about my equipment but apparently they just want as much force as they can so they happily give me a jamar. It's a colorful piece of cloth that you tie on your arm so they know I'm an ally.

I do wonder won't demons just easily figure it out and wear one too. But staff uncle tell me "I'm the first boy to wear this in a while" so I guess the demons would just think I'm some random adventurers with fancy clothing.

Julia and I arrived first at the backline. Where there're wounded and reinforcement. I ask around for information. People were very cooperative but not surprisingly, my pronunciation was bad. The information I got was the leader is a "muscular beast that flatten earth with its fist and regenerate indefinitely".

I don't think I can defeat something that regenerate indefinitely, but I'll try. Me and Julia gathered with next reinforcement line and delta together.

At the field. There're army of low level demon creating chaos while a 10 meters tall gorilla flaten soldiers with its fists. Minions aren't what soldiers worry about and can be defeat easily. The real pain in the ass is this Beast. It doesn't really tanky but due to its big size arrow tips just barely penetrate to its dermis and anyone who dare use melee weapon will just be crushed with its fists. This make magic the only reliable source of damage.

I borrow Julia's staff and start throwing random magic at it like the rest of beast folks mages. Then I remember the spell I cast at the alpha wolf. The Beast and the wolf made from the same stuff, just a bit bigger. The spell should go through it just fine.

So I form a cone shaped stone and spin it really fast to give it gyroscopicstability and put as much mana as the staff would allow me to put in a single spell into its velocity effectively turn it into artillery shell.

The spell end up launched out at mach 2. Generating a deafening sound that shock everyone including me, obliterate through the beast's body and scattered into pieces inside its guts. Even if this thing's organ regenerate from that, the pieces will rupture it again. I don't think it's going to definitely work tho so I shoot it repeatedly a bunch of time until it stop moving.

"That should be it"

@@soldier: I'm afraid no, the real concern is what happen after we killed it...

Then It just melt and emerged from the pool of its own blood... just like the ghouls summoned by dark mages. something tells me this isn't right, can something so simple-minded like this lead an army?

I killed the beast again. This time I make sure to trace the origin of the mana used to reassemble it. Turns out the real army leader is disguised as a dark mage and manipulate everything from behind.

I form multiple artillery shells high above in the sky and bombarded the whole army with it. This time however. The Beast does not emerge. The lake of blood flow back to the real leader and the moment of silence take place. The whole army have been reduced into one single entity standing in the middle of the field. Its cloak dispersed, revealing a woman with silver hair, red eyes, pink dress and black underwear. The last one was anticlimactic but was it unneeded? You decide. Anyway back to the fight.

Demon leader: I am Ivary Varory the third, the leader of the west army. Witness my majesty!

@@her mana unleashes fainted all people but me

My guts tell me to be ready for whatever she may unleash. So I do just that and shield myself with all mana Julie's staff allow me to manipulate. And I'm glad I did that. Ivary struck my shield with a scythe and it perfectly shattered and stopped the blade from stabbing my skull. I quickly counter with the earth cannon spell but it can't penetrate her barrier.

Ivary: I've seen enough of that!

She fire a ray of black flame in my direction. I tried blocking it with earth dome or ice wall. But the flame melt through everything I put against it path.

I compressed the air in the surrounding area to a single point and let it rebound. Create a pressure wave that should extinguish the flame but it disperses the flame everywhere instead, Burning down nearby forest and melting rocks. I pressure sprayed steam into the bruning area to calm things down. But I shouldn't have focused on something other than ivary. She slapped me with invisible hand and send me flying.

I sustained savere injuries just from the slap so I heal myself. My magic doesn't work on her...

My magic...doesn't work?

I remember my fight with Julia.telepot magic can send anything anywhere as long as I can see the desired location. However I can't teleport things into the body of those who have more magic resistance than my intelligence. But apparently the volume inside the bladder doesn't count as the body as long as it isn't completely empty so her magic resistance won't be a factor.

I turn on my x-ray vision again. Jackpot, her bladder wasn't empty, it was quite full in fact. After seeing her bladder muscle slightly stretched from urine she was holding since who could know when. I stop taking her seriously and let my instinct do the task.

I began filling her slightly full bladder with artificial pee like the original in her bladder. Making it expand bigger and bigger. Her expression however, doesn't change much. I keep filling, now it stopped expanding. She's still attacking me but i doesn't care at at all this point.

Now with volume fixed when I fill it it just all increases the pressure inside her bladder. Her expression still pretty much the same. I afraid she may not feel the urge to pee but I'll do what I can. I fill it a lot more. A sweat run down her cheek and she's definitely gritting her teeth.

I keep putting pee in her bladder. Now she move a lot less, her projectiles look more like she's throwing random stuff now. At some point she stop all her actions. Her bladder is pressurized with pee. Her urethra fill up as her bladder relaxes. She's about to pee. I quickly seal her bladder shut. Surprise her.

Ivary: what are you doing!? Stop it!

I keep shoving pee inside her bladder

Ivary: wait wait we can talk

The pressure receptors lining her bladder surface are firing like crazy, Ivary lost her abilities to control mana. Her mind is too obstructed by these receptors telling her to pee. Her attack completely stopped. I pick up a dagger from one of many dead soldiers and approach her. Her pupils dilates, the limbs crawling trying to escape from what she interpretates as her impending doom.

Ivary: Chill chill! I'm sorry, I didn't think this through. I know I can't undo what have been done. But I swear I'll make it up! Shivers Please I don't wanna die. I can live thousands of years, I-I haven't experienced things I wanna try. I-

"You know these soldiers have the same thoughts right? You aren't just doing any bad things, You are killing."

Even after I say somting like that, I can't bring myself to kill someone I aready toy with.

"I don't kill, be relieved... or afraid"

I drag the stained dagger across her dress. I'm not being cautious, cutting some of her skin along with it. Her wound heal up fast. This is probably the thing keep her bladder from popping like a balloon inside her pelvic. I pushed down on the bulge above her crotch, it was hard as a rock literally. Her bladder was so pressurized I can barely distinguish it from a read-to-explode tire.

I infuse my hand with mana and push it down anyway. Her bladder is now felt like balloon to the touch. The demon that lead an army of thousands was screaming for me just from a little movement of my hand.

Ivary: stop! Ahhhh! My bladder is gonna- eekkk

I cut her panties strings off and let it fall off her legs, revealing her pinkish pussy squeeze in between her thighs. It's twitching as her bladder being shifted around by my hand

Ivary: This is definitely sexual harassment!

"You don't deserve dignity"

Ivary: You're not hiding it at this point! you sadistic pee fetish scum!

"Oh? first time someone call me that. Can you say that again?"

I start filling her bladder again, all whole rubbing, pushing and squeezing her bladder. I let some of her pee lose into the urethra and use mana string to tie her urethra shut from the inside. Muscle tube filled with high pressure golden liquid.

I open the outer squish of her pussy to see her vagina, and her urethra opening slightly pushed outward by the pressure. She finally reaches her limit.

Ivary: Stop it! I can't take it anymore! I'll do whatever you want! Just let me- ...WAIT!! I take that back! no, nonononono. Not like this. Noooo!

"What?"

A complex magic ring appear around her neck and collapses down into a collar. I sensed her bladder gonna explode so I released the seal and let her pee burst out.

She falls to her knees, very concerned. Both her hands on her collar, seems doesn't care a bit about the fact that she's peeing like a pressure washer. She looks like her souls left her body, looking around desperately. She let go of the collar looking down at her hand shaking then at me terrified.

"What happened?"

Ivary: I have unique ability that turn anyone promissing everything their everything in front of me into my slave. This time it work against myself and turn me into your slave-

@@she puts her hand on her mouth looks surprised. I guess she's forced to explain because apparently I'm now her master and she must do what I say

"Did you just say you turn yourself into my SLAVE?"

Ivary: Nods

I'm confused as fuck right now. I accidentally make a demon my slave and I don't know what to do.

I feel a sense of strength.

"What happened?"

Ivary: what?

"I'm feeling stronger"

Ivary: Slave passively have their stats halves to their master

I checked, and it's really shoot up. My intelligence goes from one to 50

"What's your name again?"

Ivary: Ivary Varory...

"I remember there's the third in your name, who are the other 2?"

Ivary: there's no one. I-I just thought it would be cool...

"I'm just gonna call you Ivy then"

Ivy: nods

I don't have anything to say, I'm so confused at this situation.

"To be honest, I'm so lost right now. What do I do"

Ivy: it would be really great if you let me go...

"Not so fast. What are your plans..."

She's still peeing nonstop from the amount of urine I shove inside her

"wait first of all, stop pissing"

Ivy: uh umph nods

Her pee stream stopped. She shift her legs around a bit. She's still have to pee but stop due to my command. I continue.

"What are your plan actually?"

People start waking up from unconscious state due to Ivy's mana that keep them unconscious have been halves. Julia's ears also twitching. This isn't time for interrogation. They might execute me because I talk with demon and I'm not in for that.

"You know what? It doesn't matter now just leave before someone found out and hang me or whatever"

Ivy: Thankyou sooo much!

Ivy cloak her bare bottom parts and fly off in to the sky with speed. Leaving a trail of sparkling yellow liquid that drenched her legs and anything below her crotch.

I raised Julia's staff at her, pretending to be fighting her but she gets away. After soldiers witnessed my act I fake fainted to avoid questioning.

End

Chapter 6: aftermath

The rest of the soldiers slowly wake up one by one. Once enough of them have waken up, the commander assistant take lead of the troops in place of the dead commander.

He order the soldiers to carry wounded and name tags of the unfortunate if they can to the the back line. To reform and return to Nora.

Julia wakes up and try to carry me, but ultimately failed so she decided to drag me instead. Luckily couple of soldiers scolded her and carry me with rescue stretcher, and let Julia follow them. Her body language seems to be in distress.

I feel bed for the two soldiers carrying me even with their own wounds and fracture still untreated. I can't just wake up and treat them like nothing happened cause it's too suspicious. I instead pretend to cast heal in my sleep. I don't know how it's actually cast so it's just me mumbling and make up shit. Luckily, they don't know a thing about healing magic.

I got carried to a tent in the backline for treatment. Everybody is in distress calling for healer and everything, very busy I'd say. I seems to be too natural about this, especially when we just fight a demon.

The soldiers informed the medical team I'm capable of healing magic. I immediately get promoted to be the top priority. They probably really need more healer right now. I can't wake up but I feel bad so I radiate healing aura to help them out a little.

A priestess come to my bed and start inspecting me. She can't find what's causing me to become unconscious. cause obviously, there isn't. I'm just pretending to be unconscious. She freaks out thinking I've been cursed. I also quietly freaked out hoping she won't make it a big deal.

In desperation I move around and pretend I'm sleep talking. Having no idea what should I use as a cause that won't freak out people but understandable.

A- ahhhgh "Ma...na..." arghhh

I settle with mana poisoning and moan it out in sleep. The priestess immediately take the hint, She fumbles around try to find a mana potion. But due to the amout of wounded soldiers all the mana supplies have been consumed by anybody that able to cast healing magic.

I can transfer mana to someone but I don't think she can. The priestess stare at me with desperation, she have full mana but she can't transfer it to the patient.

The priestess walks in circle. Finally she stop. She walks up to me with her face blush red. She take a deep breath and sigh. I hear a sound of clothes moving. And she climb onto my bed

I smell a little bit of urine and figured she was up to no good, so I slowly open my eye to scare her away before I have to put piss drinking into the tags.

She jumps off the bed and stand on the side of me and pretend nothing happened.

"Uhh what's happened?"

Priestess: ahh-uh ummm... you was carried here unconscious and I'm hear to treat you

"Thankyou... I thought I'm going to die..."

Priestess: I uhhh I didn't do anything... in fact you wake up on your own like miracle...

"Oh... Thankyou for watching me I guess"

I get up, sitting on the bed. I see her panties lying under between her legs. It might be bad if someone saw this.

"What's that on the ground?"

Priestess: OH MY! IT'S- IT'S NOTHING! It's just a piece of cloth... N-nothing special

@@she picked it up, hides it in her hand. Look around blushing.

Priestess: Ah Yes! I was informed you are capable of using healing magic.

"yes, to a certain degrees"

Priestess: once you recovered please help us heal other patients, we're really short of medics.

"I can do that right now actually"

Priestess: didn't you just pass out from mana deficiency? Won't you need at least like 1 or 2 days to recover?

"Oh, right... but do we need to wait that long? When are we going back to Nora?"

Priestess: couple of months?

"really?"

Priestess: we do need to wait for some soldiers to recover until we go back...

"Isn't it like 30 minutes to Nora?"

Priestess: did you fly here!? It take at best an hour, and with this much stuff... we need a week to fully clear everything back to Nora.

"That's understandable"

I don't wanna delay the soldiers in need of her presence any further so I'll just dismiss her

"I'm fine, please go see another patient in need. I'm going to wander around the camp"

Priestess: then please excuse me

@@the priestess goes behind a curtain and put her panties back on before she left.

I wait a little before I goes out using the same exit. Julia is siting on the outside waiting for me. Her ears flatten, her tail flicking, looking down. Clearly in worry. Maybe about me, maybe not. I don't know.

"Hey"

Julia: hmm? AHH! You're OK!?

"Yep"

Julia: sigh I thought I had bring someone to their death...

"Oi, that's a flag!"

Julia: sorry sorry haha. you do cheer me up, thanks.

"I'll go help the soldiers so we could go back to Nora faster"

Julia: they're tell me you got mana deficiency though...

"have you ever seen me reciting a spell?"

Julia: when I think about it... no.

"My magic seems to not work like yours. I don't have mana deficiency, I just don't want them to freak out"

Julia: Ah umph, that's understandable... I heard you fend off the demon lord.

"I couldn't get her in the end..."

Julia: What do you mean? We're expecting to lose. To fend off that monster you've proven yourself!

"Oh, ok"

I walk around the camp site, every body is rushing to treat who they could save. The critically wounded would be treated just so they wouldn't die on the spot and gathered in a tent waiting for their death. I go in and met with two priests continously switching maintaining the operation of the heal magic circle engraved on the floor.

I try to intervened but got block by guards. I tell them I wanted to help but they told me to go save the someone that can be saved. I saw soldiers with heavy wound, detached limb, savere brain damage and more. I understand why they decided to use their medixal personnel for someone else. But these people can't just be left waiting for death. Not when I can help them.

I show them my ultimatum. I pull out Julia's wand and concentrate mana on it. Julia try to stop me. Luckily They don't want more chaos more than they already have. The guards let me in.

I power the heal circle myself and start curing. I have no idea how healing magic work. All I do when I heal is imagine the damage parts repair itself, so I do just that. Limbs growing back, a hole in their chest filling up. Fractured bones going back into its place. I know the limbs growed back doesn't 100% match the original but no one complained so I'll take it.

Julia look at me in surprise. I proceed to the other tent. It's been 3 hours now and If I don't get home soon I'll be in trouble.

Main medical tent

I see hundreds of soldiers lying on mattresses, ranging from light to heavily wounded with most injured near the entrance.

I saw a priestess treating bulky soldiers with his ribs poking out. The hem of her skirt stained with urine. It caught me off guard.

"In distress of war a priestess must hold their pee to treat patients"

I get really excited and activate my x-ray vision once more. Her pee leaking out in a small stream. Her bladder is overloaded with pee, ready to explode. Her underwear drenched. The wet patch on the ground indicates she has been bursting for a long time. And another priestess and another one. They all really need a break.

I look at Julia. To my surprise, her bladder is actually full. Not crazy full like the priestess or the last times, but definitely have a hard time holding.

"have you gone to the bathroom recently?"

Julia: there's no bathroom...

"the bush?"

Julia: blush I'm too nervous to go...

"should I take you to one?"

Julia: n-no thanks, you stay and help these soldiers. I'll hold it in.

"isn't that really uncomfortable?"

Julia: if I really can't hold in I'll go on my own... having someone take me to the bush is really embarrassing.

With that I start healing the patients. Start from the entrance to the back end. I ask the priestess to help the patient in her care. She struggles to process with her bladder in constant red alert but ultimately thanks me and ran out to the nearest bush to relive herself. I quickly puts the guy's rib back into its place and continues.

Seeing hope, the other priestess focus on their jobs hoping to relieve themselves too. There's a lot of injuries but I won't detail on it too much.

Here's the list of female patients who have pee involved in their healing

- a girl who have her bladder ruptured in battle.

Cure: gather the urine in the abdomen back into the bladder and heal it back together. This resulted in her bursting all over her mattress once I released the seal cause there's so much pee stored.

- a girl who refused to use a urinal pot.

She ultimately reaches her limit and ask for it, but she doesn't put it on in time and leaked a lot.

- a girl with poison. Her bladder was so big it's able to stop the poison to reaches her heart

Cure: I have to seal her urethra shut because it was already leaking and I fear she might loses control and let the poison reaches her heart. Her bladder was stretching really badly I have to constantly heal it to stop it from rupturing. She was tearing and shaking while I extract the poison. Once I'm done she got that huge bladder bulge and was given extra big urinal. The final volume was 1039ml really impressive

- a mage with mana poisoning. She drank too much mana potion and have a seizure while I'm treating her

Cure: I let the kidneys do its job while maintaining her vitals. Her bladder was small but I don't allow her to pee cause it would drop her pressure. I need to let her pee 2 times because her bladder was really going to explode. Her pee also glows

- a girl without genital. You heard it right. Some demon decided to mend her pussy lips together. Her crotch became a smooth reddish skin without any opening. Her bladder was also bloated really bad

Cure: luckily the inside are still there I ask for a female participant to show their genital to me for me to carve it back into her. The participant was a priestess that taking care of her. She have her crotch drench in pee but I was able to model it into the girl. Once urethra opened. A lot of urine flow out.

That's most of it, Other than this is either just male or light wetting

HELP! SOMEONE HELP!

I heard someone screaming. A priestess had fall unconscious. My immediate diagnosis was from tiredness or mana poisoning but it turned out being bladder failure.

She have dried stains on her skirt and panties but no wetness present. It was quite heresy stripping a priestess clothes but I need to see her abdomen. I tell the crowd to stop watching. I quickly undress her leaving on the bandage people in this world use for bras and a cloth covering her genital.

Her bladder is bloated like every priestess but after I checked, her pussy is dry with a salt crystallize on it.

Leaking is what allow them to not explode their bladder. But this priestess stopped leaking. She have been holding for too long her bladder lost it elasticity and failed to contract. The urine builds up too much and caused her the fell unconscious.

I was thinking of giving a nudge on her bulge and let the urine be pushed out, but her bladder wall was so thinned out just a touch would burst it

I put a glass urinal against the salt coated vulva of her and start massaging her waist. I wanted to make her let out the natural way. After nothing has changed for uncomfortably too long, I open her urethra and push down her bladder while casting heal on it. Forcing the pee out. The volume was crazy. It filled up untire urinal pot and there's a lot left. She would wake up dying to pee but she's fine now.

I turn back to Julia who have been holding it in for a while now. She have a patch of pee on her shorts and rubbing her thighs together.

"why won't you go pee?"

Julia: sweat when I think about it, having you with me wouldn't be that bad...

"what?"

Julia: I'm scared...

"why suddenly? There is no demon left... is there?"

Julia: there's a lot of death soldiers right? When I was going to um... use the bush shake I hear the sounds just like in the camp but deep in the woods. Where there's nothing but corpses.

"They wanted you..."

Julia: I got really scared and ran away.

"That's terrifying... have you tried finding a quiet corner in the camp?"

Julia: I can't! The sound isn't there anymore, but it's still echoes in my head when I'm alone. I can't!

She starts hyperventilating.

"Breathe Julia BREATHE"

Julia: I'm sorry... I...

"please calm down, try thinking about Magic or something"

Julia: I don't think I can concentrate...

She's shaking both her body and voice, she's trying to act fine but I can sense she's going to have a panic attack.

I push down her bladder to distract her. Her pee won't come out tho.

Julia: hggh! AHH! Stop! Stop! It's bad! It's really uncomfortable!

"How are you going to empty this?"

Julia: I want you to go with me... to the bush.

"I don't wanna be salty, but can you let out pee in front of me?"

Julia: N-no... but it's definitely better than alone... I have better chances together...

"how about holding hands?"

Julia: nods please hurry, I really want to pee...

"can't you go in a pot?"

Julia: I can't, I'm only comfortable with toilets and bushes

"hold on, I need to tell everyone first"

Julia: Nods

Julia is holding her crotch, waiting for me to announce the importance to everyone. She's patient, but her limit is coming

APPARENTLY THERE'RE CALLING FROM THE WOODS. DON'T GO INTO THEM. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO, JUST USE A POT!

I rushed into the bush near the camp for Julia to finally relieve herself. She squeeze my hand really hard almost to the point of hurting. When we're at certain point that can't been seem,

I heard it...

The sound of a camp, from the depth of forest. It definitely NOT an echo. It sends chills down my spine. I never believed in ghost. But THIS, makes me. I only hear it faintly. But Julia would be able to hear it clearly.

She isn't able to control her urge to pee anymore and want to get it done with. She un botton her shorts. While her hand busy undressing I hold her arm. Ensures her I'm still here. She popped a squat and trying to pee. She make sure I won't see hers down there.

Julia: I- I can't

"I don't think I can either, wanna go back"

Julia: I can't take it anymore! If I go back to camp I'm gonna...

I understand, I feel so pity for her. I'll just let her get it done and go back. Easy, Easy! I heighten my senses to sense what's the actual sound is.

I listen to the sound from the depth of the forest. There's sound of soldiers. One group of soldiers talking. I listen to their conversations. Until I wasn't the only side listening...

Hey little bro,

The soldiers talk in my direction, then whispered in my ear

Come join us

"AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!"

The loudest scream I ever let out. I explode mana outward. yes, explode! I push every bit of mana outward, flatten the trees around. I picked Julia up and carry her, ascends up and slam down at the camp.

Both of us still screaming but Julia was able to frantically puts her pants back on in time. I sit on the ground shaking.

"Nahhh na na na nahhh, I'm not going there again"

Julia: I'm sorry- I'm sorry! That was a bad idea

"Worst idea"

Julia: I'm sorry!

With that sight, the commander order to forbids anyone to go into the woods

Julia haven't empty her bladder and curfew has started.

End

Chapter 7: back to Nora

I sit there hyperventilating for a while. Eventually I was able to calm myself. It was sure scary, but they couldn't do a thing to me.

After I stop panicking I start to calm Julia down before she gets serious panic attack.

She have too much stress from both her mental and body. She was not responding... she was scared to her core and with a full bladder in her body, She's overwhelmed by the pressures. I know she's trying her best but her heart rate doesn't decrease, I cant just let her be like this.

@@i honestly don't know what to do to calm her down, so I just go with petting. Nothing crazy, just me stroking her hair back and fourth gently with my hand. It was not quite effective at first but after sometimes she calm down

Her heart beats slowly drop to normal and she breathe more rhythmically. She open her teary eyes.

Julia: Pet me more...

"ok... I guess"

She calm down from a panic to slightly frightened.

Then I feel warmth on my leg.

I look what's causing it and it was Julia. A small stream of pee was able to leak out from her shorts. She's panting quietly, Must have been holding it in for a really long time.

Her bladder is relieved. It looked almost exploded but after a while it's just really full. Julia get a hold of herself and stop. She's embarrassed.

Julia: I-I want a more private place...

"that's right... sure"

I take her into a small tent and put her down, she looks at me. I sigh and start petting her head. She closes her eyes.

Julia: I can't... it's so embarrassing...

"heyyyy! Stop messing with meeee"

Julia: It can't be help! I'm so nervous!

A moment of silence later...

Julia: I want the warm water like when you wash me last time...

"Oh? You liked that one?"

Julia: don't tease meeeeee!

"ok ok"

Julia stands up, I kneel in front of her. Her crotch was so close to my face I can smell her pee, She backed away... I position my hand and ready

"I'm gonna start, ok?,"

Julia: Nods

I look into her bladder, there's a lot of pee stored in it, waiting to come out. I match my water temperature with it and start letting it flow through her crotch.

Her ears and tail stand up straight as the warm water run down through her stomach down onto her crotch.

She started to go with the water. Her bladder sphincter relaxes. The pent up urine filled her urethra, She blushes.

She relaxes her final floodgate, her pee starts to come out.

I stop the water and let her pee down her shorts.

Julia: heyyy! Don't stop! It's feeling like I'm just wetting myself!

"Well, you're peeing yourself either way"

Julia: but I feel better peeing into the stream!

"you can't stop, can you?"

Julia: Nghhhh... no... blush

@@help out

After Julia was done, I thought I should go help them clean up the camp. The soldiers are healed. There's no reason to stay longer.

I go out the tent to met the sight of many girl, I mean tons of them really desperate to pee but couldn't find private spot inside the camp.

Some of them already have stained on their robe(most of people here wears it) some wet themselves already.

I ask Julia to write "female bathroom" on a sign and put it up over the entrance of the tent we just use. In there I gathered buckets and cloths for them to use.

They would pee into the buckets. Use the cloths to wipe their private and cover the urine filled bucket, allowing them to carry it without too much embarrassment and dump to the outside of the camp

The girls are delighted by the bathroom and form a line waiting to use it. After a while there's pool of pee where they decide to dump it.

I moved on and help clean up the tents. I would let the soldiers take care of the tent cloth and things inside it. Until all it left was Pilars and supports.

I would unearth them thrm telekinesis and lay them on the wagons. Peoples in the came they look at me with too much amazement, so I tune it down only lifting only one at a time. Until it's all done.

Since that's what takes the most time clearing, we're now only need to March back. It's takes 2 hours with wagons but it's already evening. I was asked to help escort the army but I declined.

Farewell to the fallen

Before I leave I walk into the forest one more time, this time with confidence. I hear the same uncanny sound but I continue. I reached the sea of blood, The area where the war take place. I hear the same spirit talking to me.

It's you! Are you here to join us?

The soldier spirit joking to me, smiling. I take a deep breath and sigh.

I cast a large magic circle and send every spirit to heaven.

@@guess not haha! wave

I stick out my tongue as they dissapear. That's what you get for teasing me.

After that I reunite with the army.

I'm here for like 4 hours already. if time pass at the same rate it would be 8 pm by now.

It's not like my house is strict, but they would be worried. I don't think my parents care very much but I don't wanna leave my little sister alone.

I excuse myself and Julia to the commander and go ahead to Nora.

Nora

By the time I'm at Nora, the sun is already setting. I ask Julia if she could lead me to the gate so I can go home.

"can you take me to the gate?"

Julia: it's already late, how about you just stay the night here?

"I need to go home"

Julia: Can we go tommorow?

"I need to go today"

Julia: why do you want to go home that bad?

"I have little sister to take care of"

Julia: OH... I...I- I understand B-But! Sweats

"What are you hiding?"

Julia: Nothing?

I let the silence judge her

Julia: I'm scared of darkness...

I sighed. think about it, if I were to force her to take me to the gate, she would have to walk 30 minutes back to Nora in darkness. I'm not that cruel... maybe.

"I'll go there myself then"

Julia: just so you know... the gate can't be open at night...

"heyyyyy~! Just say that in the beginning!"

Julia: sorry...

"Where should I stay... I got no money"

Julia: My Tuma?

"Excuse me, the fuck is a Tuma?"

She's shocked, her ear flatten, her tail drop, closing her eyes. She's look scared and upset. I suspect it was the translation.

"sorry, I think that's a mistranslation. I mean I don't understand what is "Tuma""

Julia: You aren't mad at me? Look up

"Nonono, not at all. I think I used sensitive words and it translate literally"

Julia: so you're not gonna beat me up?

"no!"

Julia: It's- It's where people rent a room and lives... I can give you money for that...

"an apartment?"

Julia: fire?grass?

"Nothing"

I think it transliterate "apartment" to her and she tried to make sense of it by saying words that sound alike and then translate back to me in English. Now I know "fire" and "grass" sounds like "apartment".

"anyway, what I said back there was that scary?"

Julia: you suddenly say a bad word and sounded angry...

"Fuck you"

Julia: blush what!? That's- that's embarrassing! I'm not ready!

Oh... it just translate that literally...

I grinned

"What did I say?"

Julia: I- I don't wanna say it out... blush

"it's fine, I wanna know how bad was that"

Julia: It's- it's not rude but...

"come on, say it"

Julia: s- se- sexual i- Intercouse with... me...

"WHOA!"

Julia: it's so embarrassing!

"pussy"

Julia: little cat? You're so random...

It's translating literally...

"vulva"

Julia: EEKKK! What!? WHAT? Why did you say that!!?

"Both of those words can mean the same thing" point at her crotch "one is a slang one is the actual word"

Julia: blush you... you are so perverted

"ok ok, move on. I'm gonna call Tuma "apartment" ok?"

Julia: o-ok

"Where is it? your apartment,"

Julia: follow me... don't say that again, ok?

"vagina"

Julia: I- I guess you could say that instead, but it's still... very straight...

Huh? I guess apparently in this world they decide vulva was more valued as feminine part? I guess once she's comfortable to let you see it you might as well see the vagina.

Julia leads me to the Tuma, where she tried to rent a room next to her for me but it's all filled tonight. The keeper said the room next to her will be available tommorow.

Julia sighed and order 2 dinner. the keeper's eyes sparkles, she ask Julia if she finally finds a boyfriend. Julia blushes and say I'm just foreigner friend visiting, a Good cover up!

Julia lead me to her room, she takes of her robe and the dagger strap on her right thigh. She said I should wander around the Tuma. I think she's going to undress and bath. So I walked out the room and wander around.

I say hi to our neighbor who lives in the opposite room next to ours. She looks very kind, she also have brown dog ears and a tail. I talk to her a little and get asked if I'm Julia's boyfriend. I said "no, I'm a foreigner friend came to visit" then she stop asking further and tell me have a nice day.

I go down to the dining hall but get told to take a bath first. I understand, People would have their body full of sweat by this time of the day, so if they just all gather here it would absolutely smell like sweat. I figure it was a good time to recreate a little service scene.

I went up the stairs, and go into Julia's room. I see her clothes on the floor, time for a service scene I guess.

I walk to the front of the door, grip the handle.... and finally, the bathroom scene.....

Julia: I'm using the bathroom!

"Oh! Ok"

I backed up. How could this be? she said it before a could open the door. Maybe it's her ears that able to hear better. "Dammit" I thought to myself.

Julia: I'm coming out! Let me put on my clothes first!

"ok"

Julia walk out the bathroom, there's steam around her.

Julia: you can use it now...

"sure"

Julia: you can use my clothes if you want

"I'll just clean mine with magic"

Julia: if you said so...

I went in the bathroom, splash myself with bucket of water and go in the bath. Julia's bath water... I wander what the norm in this world is. I won't complain tho. It smells nice.

After I'm done. I dry myself, wash my clothes and put it on. Coming out in like 5 minutes. Julia look at me and tell me to the dining hall together.

I got stopped by guards telling me to go bath, I tell them I bathed. They don't believe me since I'm wearing the same clothes. But I tell them to smell me. They hesitate but do it eventually. They apologize and let me through.

When me and Julia came in. A waitress escorts us to the table, There were 2 plates of dinner ready. We sit and started eating.

Julia: I'm sorry about dragging you here

"it's okay"

Julia: What about your little sister?

"if she can microwave the food it should be fine"

Julia: spice cloth?

"mi-cro-wave, it's how we warm food up"

Julia: microwave? ...Why do you need to warm the food? Shouldn't it be hot when it's made?

"I made them this morning"

Julia: it would have rotted by now... there's no saving it

"I put it in the "fridge""

Julia: ice?

"if you hear something strange just assume it's my language"

Julia: Nods Fridge... what does it do?

"it's a cold cabinet and when the foods are cold, they don't rot. But it makes food really cold, That's why we warm it up before eat"

Julia: ohhh I see.

After we finished our meal we go to our room to go to sleep.

"can I borrow your robe?"

Julia: why?

"I'm gonna use it as pillow"

Julia: nonono I already asked them for a mattress

"Oh okay, then I'll wait. You go to sleep I'll go help them bring it up"

Julia: You can have the bed, I'll wait

"having the person who pays for my place to sleep sleep on the mattress? No..."

Julia: it's fine when that person brings you to another world to save their village and you did a good job.

"this is awkward..."

Julia: Nods

I go down to see 2 room service carrying a mattress upstairs, that's probably mine... I tell them it's fine and lift it up using telekinesis.

When everything is set. I and Julia decide who should sleep on the bed by rock paper scissor. It was Julia.

Then we sleep.

Chapter 8: back home

I wake up, slowly open my eyes.

"Huh?"

I was surprised that the sight I see isn't Julia's room... It's mine.

I also feel refreshing even though I think we sleep at like 11pm. I checked my alarm clock, it's 6 am. I skip my alarm clock so that it won't went off at 6:30, my usual wake up time.

I checked my calendar, it's the next day after I went into the portal. It must've send me back while I was sleeping.

Anyways, I go do my stuff in the bathroom, come out, dry myself and wear my uniform, ready for school.

I pick up my bag and head downstairs. I see my little sister cooking and I smell curry.

"morning Yuki"

Yuki: morning, ...wait! don't look!

I looked and see Yuki blushing, one hand stirring the curry, another covering her chest. She is wearing her pajamas and an apron though.

"didn't wear bras?'

Yuki: I didn't think you are going to wake up early!

"it's fineee, I see you naked like a thousand times already. And you're wearing an apron, it's not like anything is gonna poke out"

Yuki: you- you pervert! ...yeah you're right. Sigh

"But like, You? Cooking? Curry? In the morning? Everything is wrong here"

Yuki: What? I can cook too!

"OK, two things left, curry? In the morning? You're gonna be late and smell like curry..."

Yuki: Well... I didn't think about that...

"but why are you cooking anyway?"

Yuki: I see you come home last night and went straight to bed, didn't even bother having dinner. So I thought something happened and make you something in the morning could sheer you up.

"Nothing happened tho..."

Yuki: I know, no depress people singing downstairs and talk about my nipples

"bruh"

Wait... I came home last night? Did I walk home unconsciously while sleeping? Anyway, the curry is like 50% done, by the time she's done making she wouldn't have time to prepare for school.

"You wanna like, switch?"

Yuki: Nono it's fine.

"let me help, we're gonna be late"

Yuki: I can it this alone, go do something.

With that I'll happily take her advice. Aright I'll do something. That is of course... I turn on my x-ray vision again.

I take a peek on her bladder. it was near empty, obviously. Yuki always wake up because she have to pee, that's how she wake up. It's happen so often her alarm clock becomes useless at this point. And she would take a longgggg piss in the morning. I know this cause when we're still sleeping in the same room Yuki is most likely to wake me up at 6 am where she would shake me violently until I wake up to take her to the bathroom.

She's a big girl and have her own room now. But her habits doesn't seem to change.

Anyways, Back to the present where I try to make her want to pee. It's the same strategy, I copied and put more pee inside her bladder. Yuki feels her growing need to pee but she still keep it in. I keep the filling subtle and not so questionable, making sure she thinks it's her own pee.

She keep it to herself dispite her body language and the bladder I see suggests she need to relieve herself. She hold it in until she starts to leak then she's forced to ask me. (Nii is form of "Ani:兄" means older brother, kinda like "big bro")

Yuki: nii, Can you help me stir for a while?

"Why"

Yuki: I want to pee...

"can't you hold it? I'm kinda lazy"

Yuki: I woudn't bother you if I can, I want to pee really bad!

"how bad are we talking about?"

Yuki: can you stop? ...I'm gonna wet myself!

"ok ok"

I switched with her and let her go pee.

Yuki: Ah ah, it's gonna come out...

While she's still in the bathroom. I take the chance to accelerate the cooking process with my magic. After it's cooked. I tasted it and fix the saltiness by literally pull out the salt. By the time she finished her business and came out, I was done.

"Do You wanna serve?"

Yuki: It's done? I thought It would need to be cook for longer... wait, hold on. What kind of nonsense did you pulled this time?

"I just crank up the heat so it cook faster?"

Yuki: doesn't that just make the food burn? Look ...What? Sigh You know what? I'll just stop thinking about it.

"Sure, are you serving? You're the one making it"

Yuki: Yes, I'm gonna serve just sit and wait.

"it's 6:50 am, won't you go shower and dress for school? I'll take care of this so we won't be late"

Yuki: No, I cam manage that. I don't wanna be taken care all the time...

"Sure"

I let her serve the plates she's been doing, she brought the plates to the table then lay it down. She's standing at the side of the table her crotch is just a little lower than the table level, it's also have a wet spot between her legs.

"you peed yourself?"

Yuki: I didn't! It leaks because you're so slow!

Yuki cover the wet spot with her hand and blush. She sigh and sit at the other side of the table. Then we both enjoy the curry.

Yuki: ...It's really good! What did you do to it?

"hmm?"

Yuki: I messed up and put in too much salt, how did you fix that?

"I pull the salt out"

Yuki: What? How did you do that exactly?

"too much chemistry I don't wanna explain"

Yuki: eh? ...wait is there chemicals in here?

"I neutralized all of them"

Yuki: So there was!

After we finished the meal, Yuki go upstairs to prepare for school. I just sit snd watch some YouTube videos about the game I play.

After sometimes Yuki rush downstairs with all her stuff, she ask me if we're late. I check my watch and it's 7:44 am. If we run we can make it.

We both grab our bags and leave. Running through any shortcut we know and arrived at the school it time. Yuki is huffing, exhausted. I wait for her and go through the gate together. Where I wave to her because we study in different buildings, We separated.

I walk to my class, open the door and says hi to my friends. Then I sit next to Sarah cause thats my seat. She's drinking her morning coffee I guess. I said morning to her, she look at me and seems embarrassed. I forgot what had just happened yesterday since I'm all busy with the other side. We sit awkwardly.

Sarah: Thanks for the yesterday, I don't think I could made it without your advice

"You're welcome I guess"

Sarah: Keep it a secret, okay?

"Sure, how did it goes?"

Sarah: Eh? What should I say If you ask like that? ...I went in the bathroom just in tine I guess. Afterwards it felt really relieved, I thought my bladder would burst...

"Is your bladder okay?"

Sarah: it's kinda ache a little but I'm fine now. How do you know about this pee holding technique?

"I have little sister who always have pee emergency, I just remember her holding techniques"

Sarah: Oh, your little sister...

I perk up a little when she mentioned her bladder. I always was a fan of girl bringing up their pee desperation.

"What's the next period anyway?"

Sarah: homeroom?

"No, I mean the next one"

Sarah: math?

"Bruh, I forgot the book"

Sarah: You can watch with me, Let's put our desk together in math class.

"Oh, thanks."

We have the homeroom teacher telling us about the field trip next Monday to some ancient city and market at the other city. Sarah ask if she could sit with me since she isn't able to fit in with other girl, to which I said Sure. Do you know how much I can brag my friend with that? And omo situation I might encounter? It's win win Boi.

We have another 20 minute of my homeroom teacher absolutely destroyed us about the cleanliness and the work we haven't finished. But after that it's break before math.

Sarah: Should we do it now?

"okay" moves my desk to hers

Sarah: Umph! Brings out math books

We arrange the stuff on the tables so the book is on the middle between the tables. Then not so long after the math teacher comes in, she looked at us then she squint her eyes. She noticed we're sitting together because we're sharing a book so she continues walking in and starts the class like normal and let us be.

After the lesson was over. I checked the schedule, It was biology. I moved my table back to place and pack my stuff to move to the lab.

Sarah followed me to the biology lab and sit with me. My friends are in the front so they don't look back to talk much since biology teacher is a dick ...well just strict but we hate him for that. We learn about urology which is kinda awkward for me and Sarah But I enjoyed the slides.

1 hour has passed and Sarah started shifting her body around. Then I remember the coffer she had this morning and how she didn't visit the toilet a single time. She probably have to pee but chose to follow me around. But now her bladder is full

Sarah: Alex(yeah that'smy name), I really want to pee... what should I do?

"Eh? So suddenly. How bad? In scale of 1 to 10"

Sarah: 7, it's not like last time but I don't think I could hold it in for another hour...

"try don't move much, compress your bladder down until you barely hold it in"

Sarah: how would that help me? I might pee myself!

"just hold it, it tricks your body to think your bladder is full so it slow down the urine production "

Sarah: I see... tries Ahh nnngh it's worse than I thought...

"keep it in, it's kind of bladder training"

Sarah: Ahh, I-Is this good?

"I don't know, if you really need to pee like it's bursting it should be okay"

Sarah crossed her legs and bent down to squeeze her bladder. Seeing her bladder squish in x-ray it's kinda cute. I don't know how much coffee did she have but her bladder fill up pretty fast. Not too long it's start making her body jolts a little.

Sarah: I can't take it anymore! What should I do?

"release the pressure you're putting on your bladder, gives your bladder back the capacity"

Sarah: puts legs down Hahhh, i feel so much better...

"Now you know how it feels when you really about to pee right? Keep the pressure steady"

Sarah: I don't wanna push it in anymore! It felt so overwhelming....

"okay"

She keep it in for sometime but she drank too much coffee that the gained capacity filled in no time. I can see her bladder bulging out a little. But with x-ray vision her bladder was not a little. It's bloating because of the pee she's been holding.

Sarah: I can't hold it anymore! I'm gonna ask the teacher!

"don't! You know how Mr. Lockwood is. He's not gonna let you go"

Sarah: but it's the students right to use the bathroom!

"he didn't let us bring water in, how do you think he would let us let our water out?"

Sarah: B-but I'm gonna pee myself!

"he's teaching about the bladder. If you go up to him telling him your bladder is full, what do you think will happen? He probably gonna get you to be the subject"

Sarah: ...I don't wanna be his subject... what should I do? I can't posdibly hold it in for more 40 minutes!

"keep holding it steady, when he turn around we sneak out. His old ass won't notice a thing!"

Sarah: I don't know how long I can wait... every seconds I feel like it's gonna come out.

"I know, but it's the only way I can think of"

We waited for the professor to look away from us. While doing so I watch Sarah trying to not leak but after sometime has passed and teacher still looking she starts to lost her control. I can't help her relieve since we're not allow to bring water so she have to store every drop of urine in her own bladder. At some point she leak out some because her bladder was too full it might burst.

Finally that old dick turn around to find something. I get up and pull Sarah's hand. Turned out she have passed her limit to the point she can't move normally anymore. I figure there's no time so I carry her out before the professor turn around.

After we got out Sarah squeeze my hand. I might have put too much pressure on her bladder she can't help but telling me to stop. Her skirt start dampening.

Sarah: it's coming out Alex, I can't take it anymore.

"hold on just keep it in a little longer"

Her mind and bladder give up halfway to the bathroom. Her bladder was so big I hesitate but at last I decide to lock her urethra with magic before she could start peeing in my arms.

I got to the bathroom, where I don't know which gender should I go in. Sarah can't stand on her own so I can't just let her down and wait. She begged me so I carried her inside the women's bathroom and sit her on the stall then leave to wait outside.

Sarah bunches up her skirt and take off her panties, ready to relieve her aching bladder. But then I hear her shouts for help

Sarah: I can't pee!

"what!?"

Sarah: I can't pee!! It won't come out!!

Shit, I forgot to release the seal I put on her urethra

"try do a gentle push around your bladder!"

Sarah hold the breath and push on the area around the bulge. She did not dare to push down directly because it might burst. She give her bladder a jump start to start voiding all her pee. I unlock her urethra so she could finally pee.

I hear her pee coming out her urethra and splash down onto the toilet bowl. It was a long and strong stream. If I wasn't continuously healing her bladder wall it would have tear and rupture so that was expected. She keep peeing hard for sometime eventually the pressure went down. Her stream start slowing down and became a trickle. Then I heard a big sigh from her, I guess She's done.

I hear the sound of Sarah bunching toilet paper and wipe her delicate part, maybe it's because she held too much in There's actually significant amount of urine left in her so I give her bladder a little nudge to push it out. It flow out onto her hand and the tissue she's been holding. I let Sarah clean herself and wait for her to come back out.

We walked back to the biology lab together, Now comes the hard part. as well as going out, Going in also need good timing. Accept this time we can't see the professor, atleast not sarah.

I use my x-ray vision but this time tuned to see Mr Lockwood. When he look back I grab her hand and run to the seat. Luckily we made it without him noticing. When Sarah sat down I heard a faint "jab" sound of her wet panties contact with the chair.

Sarah: Thankyou soooo much! I almost become a laugh stock for the class if I was just a little bit late!

"our classmates aren't that cruel, are they? They won't make fun of you. We understand your suffering. Most of us also need to hold it in. You just happen to reach your limit"

Sarah: Are you sure?

"Noticed how no one snitches?"

Sarah: You're right... thankyou, I could never made it without you.

"You're very welcome!"

Sarah: it's kinda embarrassing, but my bladder still aching like I need to pee, what should I do?

"If you allow me I can massage your bladder for that"

Sarah: I guess it's fine, just my tummy okay?

"ok"

Her bladder is bloated by the large amout of pee she held earlier so it feels like there's pee inside and ache because the bladder wall is damaged.

I intrude my hand into her shirt and rub on her bladder, of course it does nothing. It's just an excuse to touch her belly. I heal her bladder to its original shape and done.

We kinda sit awkwardly after that.

Chapter 9: living in both dimension

After Mr Lockwood finish reaching us. he gave presentation due Tuesday, the day after both weekend and Monday that we go to the school trip, A total dick move if you ask me trying to steal our sweet weekend.

We pack our stuff and head to the cafeteria since it's lunch time now. Sarah followed behind my back to the table but she seems too nervous to ask, So I'll be the one to start.

"wanna join? We have some seat left"

Sarah: is that so? ...will I be bothering you guys?

"we chill, right dudes?"

My friends make noises that indicate affirmation ranging from yep, yup to monkey noise

Sarah: if that's the case, excuse my intrude. Sit

"You're welcome"

Most of us including Sarah put their stuff down on the table to free their hand and go buy food. But today I have curry Yuki made this morning so I just bring out my lunch box then wait for my friends to come back and eat together. Couple of my friends who's back on the table or didn't go buy food ask me about Sarah and I if we're going out or something, I guess it's because we suddenly become close together. I denied their assumption and just say "she's chill" then everyone just stop asking

When all of my friends are at the table we start eating together. Me and my friends start having some gossips about that grumpy old man but in the end we can do nothing about it. Sarah sit awkwardly listening to me and my friends absolutely destroying Mr Lockwood, trying to fit in conversation. I notice her and change the direction of the conversation to match the type she is familiar with, then I nod at her. Sarah blush a little and nod back. she in now able to join our group.

We eat and talk until all of us finished our lunch. I go walking with Matthew and Sarah, we talk about the next class, it was history class. While we were walking we walk past a lady bathroom, Sarah was a little shy but she excused herself. It was such a moment, is this character development?

She went in and does her business, when she comes out I asked her. She replied "when I really weight it out, telling someone I need to use the bathroom is better than holding it in". I almost clapped, but It's now gonna be harder for me to tease her which is kinda make it more rewarding... Eh,whatever. I'll just walk to the next class

In the history class the lesson was usual. I starts to feel really sleepy, like too sleepy. It's boring yes, but It's not the same as I Always feel. I try to fight it but ultimately failed and fell asleep on the spot

Familiar room

I Open my Eyes to a total darkness, I'm a little afraid but I composed myself and give Myself a night vision. I'm laying on a mattress, I also see a wooden ceiling and stone brick walls just like in Julia's room.

Was I being teleported again? But then something hit me. I feel like I have to pee really bad, That's probably why I wake up.

I try to get up but there's something holding onto my legs, something feline...

And here she is, Julia's hugging my legs like it's her body pillow ...Am I now the victim of this story? Nope, no way.

I turn on my x-ray vision with intention of throwing my burden onto her bladder. To my surprise It was already full. She's sleeping with that much pee? She's gonna wet the bed sooner or later... but then I got an idea. I teleport my pee into her bladder just enough to make her want to pee really bad and get up slowly so she doesn't wake up.

I got into the bathroom make sure she could hear the door shut. With my see though vision, I see her ears perk up a little but Julia didn't wake up. I get somewhat confused, her bladder was THAT full but she didn't budge sleeping like nothing is going on. I nudge her bladder a little so she could feel the desperation and wake up. And she did.

Julia Open her eyes and sniff a little before she slowly put one of her hand on her crotch.

I can see her middle finger guide along the cleavage of her pussy to see if she leaked, fortunately she didn't. So Julia do what people do when they want to pee really bad, she comes to the bathroom which I'm in. I intentionally leave the lock on for this moment.

Julia Open the bathroom door to see me standing in front of the toilet peeing, I'm sure I was standing just in the right angle she wasn't able to see mine so it's all calculated.

Julia take a moment for her eepy brain to process, she blush and immediately close the door while apologizing.

Julia: I- I'm sorry! I just have to pee really bad I didn't notice you're here! I swear didn't go in on purpose!

"It's okay, girls also have curiosities too"

Julia: No! I'm really not peeking, I just wanted to pee!

"Don't mind Don't mind, I know, I'm just teasing you"

Julia: nggh! don't mess with me!

It was getting too comedic so I let my pee out to make her remember what have we been doing.

Julia: ah! I forgot, sorry. Let me just cover my ear. Blush

I keep peeing for a very long time, I start to get confused my self. I've never peed since I crossed the gate and now I'm peeing a lot.

I think Ivy's stats also boost my bladder capacity or something... I keep on peeing for somtime Julia have to call me out.

Julia: i don't want to be pressing but are you done yet? I start to feel like it's going to leak...

"I'm trying"

I see Julia clutching her middle finger between her slit. Her bladder got really big storing that much inside. She hasn't been waiting really long but she very desperate.

Julia: Pease come out soon, I can't wait for long... it's- it's very urgent!

After seeing Julia struggle to hold her pee for sometime I ran out of pee, I almost finished. I don't want to let her pee yet so I create water to fall into the toilet.

Julia: a-are you teasing me?

"No? I'm trying my best, have you noticed I didn't pee all day?"

Julia: I'm sorry...

At this point Julia just want to empty her bladder. She have been holding it for very long her bladder is reaching its limit. She feel rude and embarrassed to ask but she needs to, both of her hands supporting the base of her bulge bladder.

Julia: I'm sorry for asking this but do you perhaps able to stop mid s-stream? I really need to use to toilet...

"hold on... just a second"

I fake zipped my pants and pretend to do some stuff just to make her more desperate, then I Open the door to let her in

Julia: Thank you so much!

I feel like it would be a waste if she just let it all out when she's already holding this much in her bladder but nothing I can do....or can I? I now have more intelligent stat than her magic resistance.

I tie a little string of mana around her bladder neck, deny anything that try to come out.

Julia is confused why she can't pee she double check her crotch multiple time before conclude it was because she's nervous, The only thing making her unable to pee so far.

Julia: I-I can't pee... can you give me a little privacy?

"I'm waiting for you to finish"

Julia: I'm really sorry to interrupt, I can't take it anymore and I must pee so...

"it's okay, just start pissing already"

Julia: ngggh... mmmh... ahhh... I can't it won't come out.

She tried to pee. her bladder contracting multiple time but the way out is blocked so her pee can't come out no matter what. I let her try a little.

"How about we switch? I really need to continue. And you'll be able to pee with ease once there's no one pressing you"

Julia: b-but! ...I understand....

Julia puts her pants and underwear back on before coming out. I go in and make some pee noise for a moment and come back out. Immediately Julia rush back in and sit on the toilet.

Julia: I can't hold it anymore!

I let her try to pee but now her bladder start to become overloaded. I thought it would be a good time to let her pee. But before that I have to find a good explanation.

Julia: Help me! My belly hurts! I want to pee but it won't come out!

"Eh? Why?"

Julia: don't know! Can you help me? It hurts!

"like running water down your crotch?"

Julia: I want to pee! I don't know why can't I! Anything is fine! Just make me pee!

"okay okay"

I pull the door handle a little to get her attention.

"I can't use magic through walls y'know?"

Julia: But- it's embarrassing if you're inside! Ngggh... fine, help me!

I go in to see her bottom still fully clothed despite going to release something from there.

"why won't you take off your pants?"

Julia: i-it's embarrassing I rather leave it on than be naked down under...

"aright"

I create a stream of warm water and let it flow onto the crotch of her pants, make sure it runs through her ladies part. I originally gonna release the string tying on her bladder neck to let her pee at this point but I realized I already did this.

I keep the string secure, blocking Julia from releasing her pee causing her to shake from desperation.

"did you pee?"

Julia: I can't when you're in front of me!... What if you smell It... or hear it?

"I kinda already did both..."

Julia blushes out of embarrassment and we look at each other awkwardly. Her reservoir start to become bloated, stretching to contain a whole flood she've been hiding inside. God I want to stroke that cat girl's bulging bladder.

...wait I don't need to ask God for that, I'll just do it myself.

Julia: it's hurting really bad...

"if you want I can massage your bladder"

Julia: b-l-a-d-d-e-r?

"that's where you store your pee when you're holding it"

Julia: just do whatever! I want to let it out!

I start by running my right hand across her lower abdomen, I can clearly feel a bump on there, created by the bursting bladder lying inside her pelvic area, it's a big bulge. I can see Julia is having a goosebumps in response.

I dig my thumb in the bulge, poking her bladder. This seems to cause a sudden spike of pressure that cand be detected on her bladder's receptor making It sends emergency signal to the brain that the muscle bag holding her pee is going to rip apart.

Julia: Stopppp! My tummy is gonna explode! I can't handle this!

"it's necessary, bare with it"

Julia: ahhhg! ngggh! It's- ahh

Even when her hip jolt up every time I put any pressure on it, I still massaging her bladder. The feeling of need to expell the waste liquid bloating her lower abdomen is starting to overwhelms Julia. Her bladder expand and contract following the pressure I put on it. Before her bladder can't handle it, I take the chance to dig my thumb in that bulge, she gasped.

Then right after Julia's bladder almost exploded. I untie the knot on it. Allowing the immense pressure to be released through her urethra out her pee hole and down the toilet.

I denied her every attempt to urinate and now she's actually peeing, a stream came flow out steady. Not small but not big either, she was stretching it too much her bladder went weak. All she can do was sit there letting all her pent up pee flow down the drain, Her pain was lifted.

Julia: I'm peeing, I'm peeing ahhhh~ It's heaven~

Her legs is restless, moving around. She must feel so relieving passing that much pee. After 47 seconds I counted, it stopped. She let out a huge sigh as her bladder deflated back into a little pouch in its place.

Julia: I'm done... Thankyou. My belly almost burst...

"You mean your bladder?"

Julia: I guess... if that where pee is in. It hurts really bad i I thought it was going to break.

"you mean it literally or..."

Julia: Nods

"ouch... I can feel that...."

Julia: You can go to sleep, I'll take care of my... wet clothes

"just take it off and I'll wash it with my magic"

Julia: I don't want you to see my p-panties...

"oh"

Julia: are you going out or?

"oh right"

Julia: c-can you bring me a t-towel?

"Why?"

Julia: I forgot I have nothing to wear you know? Underneath...

"I'll just bring it to you, where is it?"

Julia: No No No you can't! I'll get it on my own!

"Why tho"

Julia: It's where my clothes are and there're... no you can't look!

"What? Pads?"

Julia: Pads? What's that? Whatever just give me the towel!

"here you go"

Julia: you can go sleep now, I need to change

"aright"

I went to bed and continue my sleep. It was so easy my conscious left my body the moment my head touched the pillow. Then I wake up in my classroom. I look up to see Sarah waking me

Sarah: hey, Alex, hey! Wake up! We need to go to the chemistry lab! We're running late!

"I-I guess"

Joe: see? He just need his crush to wake him up

Matthew: dude is down bad

"shut up"

Joe: is simpy boy mad? Am I making you mad simpy boy?

"fuck you, you peepee boy on the bus, you broken leg boy at the sleep over, you tripped into the bush boy at the park, you rejected boy in the highschool, you-"

Joe: fuck you too!

Sarah: are you guys really friends?

Us:yeah, besties actually

Sarah: you guys are so...complicated...

"why?"

Sarah: if someone tell me that, I'm gonna be crying in the bathroom

"oh... we meant nothing! It's just funny to do! There's no hate! Right, Joe?"

Joe: yeah, fuck you!

"fuck you too!"

Sarah: can we not... throwing profanities at each other right now?

Us: okay ma'am.

We moved on and go to the chemistry lab. On the way Sarah take a quick visit to the ladies room, probably to let out all the tea she had at lunch. Me and my friends also think it's a good time to take a piss too since we're already waiting for Sarah, might as well just do something. We got out and waited a little before Sarah comes out. Daniel check his watch and oh shit, we're all late.

We run to the lab as fast as we could and managed to be only 7 minutes late, luckily the teacher isn't here yet. When she's in, she start the class. we studied about biochemistry, which I wish I understand. We guys collectively acting like a drying fish as our shared single brain cell struggles to comprehend what's going on.

We got assigned to do group reports on... what's that again? Whatever. All we know is we're doomed. But God still have mercy for us, it was 6 person assignment.

There's me, Matthew, Joe, Daniel and Peter who called in sick today, There's a place left for one person.

We all look at Sarah, holding her note.

Joe: Ms Sarah, our lord and savior. Would you be so kind and carry our humble group?

Sarah: u-uhh what?

"you wanna join our group and carry us? We're doomed here"

Sarah: s-sure, if you wanted me to.

Matthew: oh we do, we're begging you actually.

Sarah: then I'll join

Us: yippee!

After the class it'll be the end of today's school. Since there's not much happening I won't be going into detail on this part but we all said goodbye and head home.

Sarah house is on a different path I use to walk home. speaking of which I have to go the other route than the one with emergency alley because I have groceries to buy. Shame, I can't see a girl pissing there today. But I figured I watch enough already.

I go to the market to buy potatoes, carrot, onion, garlic and so on. Then I go buy meat. We also have just little butter left so I'll go to the supermarket as well.

I arrived at the supermarket, I go straight to butter and pick one up. there's a row of pudding Yuki likes nearby so I picked one up as well. Before there're thousands of item in my cart I went straight to the cashier. There's a line but It probably won't take long to be my turn.

I was humming songs while waiting before a small girl park her cart behind me. I look at her and at first I thought she was a middle school girl but then I see the bow on her uniform. Is she in the same year as me?

I see her looking around nervously and shifting her legs around. Is this destiny? To find people who have to pee at the time? Thank God? I turn my x-ray vision on and see what I'm not expecting.

Not only her bladder but her whole urinary track is filled with pee. Her urethra, bladder, ureter were brimming with urine but she show such little desperation for that much held in. Hell, her panties still dry.

"Are you in a hurry Ms? Here, go ahead"

@@girl: Thank you, I really need to get home right now.

"You're welcome"

I let her go ahead since I have had enough for today. A queue later and it's her turn. She bring out a little cute bunny wallet, use a membership card to pay her purchase and rushed off. I checked out and walk home wondering how long have she been holding her piss.

When I got home I just put everything in the fridge and go to my room to play video games. Unlike me, My sister is in a club. Which make her return more late than me.

I turn on my pc and plays a couple round of fps game with my friends before Yuki get home. She came shouting upstairs

Yuki: Nii! The dinner! I'm hungry!

"Let mom cook! I'm tired!"

Yuki: mom and dad won't be home today!

"Then wait! I'm playing in a match!"

Yuki: I'm hungryyyyy!

"pudding's in the fridge!"

Yuki: okay, love you!

"love you too!"

Daniel: bro, you talk to your little sister like that?

"yeah why?"

Daniel: I could never

"Yuki's chill"

Daniel: damn, switch sister?

"nah"

Even if Yuki's only my half blood related sibling, she's a good siblings and I adore her with my heart. I wouldn't trade her for anyone.

Oh yeah, quick back story. My dad got a Japanese girl who's now my stepmother pregnant while I'm like 5 and divorced with my real mom. That's why our name are totally different. My step mom love me tho, so no drama. When I say mom, it means her. Not my actual mother.

"Imma go now, Yuki's hungry"

Joe: just one more round

"you know last Saturday you said that and we sleep at like 6 in the morning, right?"

Matthew: just let Alex go, you're starving his sister

Joe: when you're back I'll be In diamond

"is that what's bronze called nowadays?"

Joe: Hey!

I take off my headset and go downstairs. when I went down the stairs, Yuki was gone. I think she already went up to her room, but that doesn't trouble me.

I checked the ingredients available and think steak might be a good so I start season the meat, chop up the garlic and throw that in the buttered pan. I liked medium well so I have to wait 4 minutes. While waiting I chop the carrots and broccoli. When I'm done chopping the vegetable it was time to flip, so I flipped the steaks and prepare the table. When it's done cooking I take the steaks out and throw in the vegetable to cook in that meat juices.

When the plates all set, I feel like something is missing. I think it's too empty so I throw peeled potatoes and milk in the blender because I'm a moron and proceed to make mashed potatoes in the worst way possible.

Then I call Yuki to dinner by shouting upstairs.

"dinner's ready!"

Yuki: I'm coming!

After some time, Yuki came down, we sat on the table and began eating.

"hehe, you came"

Yuki: ? ...Neeeee! Stop acting like a kid! You know I said coming!

"Oh God, the dinner I ready but my little sister is masturbating what do I do?"

Yuki: Neeeeeeeeee! I'm nooootttt!

"did you have a good time?"

Yuki: yes- you idiot, I didn't!

"at this point the food would turn cold"

Yuki take a single bite and mumble while eating

Yuki: 兄ちゃんバカ [big brother, you idiot]

"おい、わかるぞ"[Oi, I understand that]

Yuki: 何でもない...[Nothing...]

After being with her and her mother I picked up some Japanese, so I understand when she's talking like this.

Anyway, we eat the dinner while watching TV until we're done.

Yuki: thanks for the meal

"You're welcome"

Yuki: tch

"oi"

Yuki: I'm going bed

"You do the dish"

Yuki: fine

"sweet dreams!"

Yuki: you-

I went upstairs and continue playing with my friends, before stopping early and go to sleep.

@@with all that happened, I concluded that my conscious will go to the other side when I'm sleeping in this and return when I sleep in that side like wise. I also notice the time dilation in both side. It compressed my entire day I was awake into 6 hours of sleep. And my bodies at each side are separated, I don't experience sleepiness because my body at this side is sleeping while I was gone.

Great I'm experiencing 3 times more life.

End

Chapter 10: sin of lust

I wake up on the mattress with loud noise of banging on the wooden window.

I looked around but I can't find Julia. I panicked a little fearing Julia might have abandoned me. I check around the room but she's gone, There's only a note on the door.

However eventhough i can understand this side language but I cannot read them, I tried to read but the banging noise was getting on my nerves. So I shoved the window open to scare whatever banging it. But then I recognized a familiar torn pink dress.

Ivy: master! I need to pee!

"Huh?"

Ivy is levitating outside the window with her hands shoved between her legs. Holding her pee in.

"what's going on?"

Ivy: you need to let me pee! I can't hold it anymore!

"why do you need my permission to pee?"

Ivy: last time you order me to hold my pee in, so if you don't cancel the order I can't pee!

"why would I do that?"

Ivy: my bladder is going to explode and I'm gonna die! Please!

"With this much kill you probably deserve every death known"

Ivy: I'm sorry... but if I die, I wouldn't be able to make up for my sin! I'll make it up! Just let me pee and I'll... Hahn~ p-pee...

"Okay, Come down"

Ivy complied and descends down onto the floor of Julia's room, of course I turn on my x-ray vision and check her bladder out. It's pressurized with pee she've been holding since last time but none managed to leak since it's an order. I wonder how she slept while her bladder's full?

Ivy: master... the toilet...

Ivy hurriedly reminds me of her desperate need before I fell into a deep thought.

"before that, read this note for me" point at Julia's note

Ivy: nggh... to Mr. Hero, I have left early to report our experience in the last demon war at the Yaha. I have left you 3 gold under you bed, forgive my lack of wealth but that's all I have. I will be home at noon -from Julia doldora

"I see, so we're together until noon"

Ivy: master, I really really have to pee... can I use the toilet now?

"go into the bathroom"

Ivy: yes sir...

"take off your underwear"

Ivy: nggh... haah...

"bunch up your dress and sit on the toilet"

Ivy: allow me, let me pee!

"hold it in"

Ivy: I knew it! You pee fetish bastard! ...I-I take that back, please don't hurt me...

"Push on your bladder"

Ivy is shocked by the order. Did I just tell her to push her distended bladder down? It would be torturous to play with her sensitive urine container like that, she tried to stop her hand but there's noting she can do against order

Ivy: forgive me! That's not what I meant! Don't make me do this!

Ivy try to stop but her hand doesn't. She can only brace herself for what is to comes. Her right hand dig it's thumb into the bladder bulge, Ivy screamed but the other hand is keeping her mouth shut. Her legs curl up and shrivel to cope with her bursting bladder being compress.

Ivy: ugh hggugh Ahhhh!! Master! I want to pee! Ahhhh!!!

"harder"

Ivy: nonono arghhhh!!! My bladder's gonna explode! Master!!

I see her bladder stretching while getting squished around by its owner's hand. If it has a feeling it must be cursing at its owner's ungratefulness

I still would like to make her hold more so I didn't said anything.

"put up your underwear"

Ivy: But I haven't pee yet... I can't take it anymore!!!

"I can't just let you use Julia's toilet, you'll have to piss outside"

Ivy: I won't make it, my bladder's already... it's stretching so bad I can feels every drop of pee in it!

"I can't let you walk around like this either, act like a normal girl as if you have no urine in your bladder, this is order"

Ivy: Yes Master! Where should we go? The forest?

"we should visit Julia first, shall we? Oh right, your bladder won't be able to stand it"

Ivy have no choice but to do what I said and suppress her urge.

She acted like a normal girl despite her bladder bulging out. I tease her a little before I go outside. Where I see the dog lady from yesterday again and greet her

Dog lady: Ah! You from yesterday. I've heard your legend~ thanks Mr. hero

"it's my pleasure, My name is Alex. I might stay here for a while, figure I should introduce myself"

Dog lady: Nice to meet you mister Alex~ my name is Anna yofuma. The girl behind your back is?

I stumbled around trying to find explanation

"she's um... my friend, Ivy"

Ms Anna: Nice to meet you Ivy~

Ivy: N- Nice to meet you, miss Anna...

Ivy greet Ms Anna with no sign of what's happening inside her full bladder. She continued to store her waste liquid into her... oh, there's no room to fit.

I take her out to walk, until I notice it starts to become dangerous with bladder wall stretch as thin as a few millimeters. I walk her out the town.

While we walked through the forest Ivy suddenly tug on my shirt.

When she bend down to ease her urge, she felt a sharp pain like someone stabbed her in the bladder. She know her container Har just broke

Ivy: Master, I believe my bladder has just ruptured...

"really? Oh..."

Ivy: If it wasn't for you and your stupid time buying I wouldn't be dying like this!

"what you mean dying, I can just heal your bladder back"

Ivy: what? Nonono not the healing magic, it'll burn, No!!!

Her bladder really ruptured due to hypertension, So I have to repair it. She is very scared because she probably burns in devine magic. but I my healing doesn't come from God's, so her bladder is repaired without a problem.

Ivy: what happened? I didn't burn?

"my healing is not sacred, I don't even know gods here"

I saved her from blood poisoning and infection but she didn't seems happy. Maybe because that made her be subjected to the overloaded bladder again.

Her bladder is holding so much urine it's actively pushing other organs out the way and make a huge bulge above her crotch, she continued to hold her pee walking seemingly endlessly to her without hope to relieve her dying need for urination

Ivy: it hurts, my bladder hurts... I want to die...

Die? Last time she still ask for mercy and now... I guess she's in so much pain she think it's better to die?

I don't like that... what I like is desperation not the pain so I'm gonna fix that

"should have just told me"

Ivy: ?! Ah ah ah! pee! I want to pee! My bladder feels so tight! I want to let it out!

"No, not right now"

I fix the problem by messing with her nerves and make all pain receptor sends desperation signals instead. The result is her pain ease and her urge to pee sky rocketed.

Her posture changed from almost crawling in the agony into fidgeting around desperate to let her urine be free.

"Master, you like pee right? I'll let you watch, I'll pee on you, I'll pee like a dog, I'll do anything. Let me do it please!

"if I wanted to I can just order you though..."

Ivy: Ahhhhh, just let me pee!

"Let's go deeper, you don't wanna be seen by wandering adventurers are do You?"

Ivy: At this points, I'll happily pee in the middle of the town square if I get to relieve my bladder...

"Nope, you're doing it like a lady"

Ivy: hah, it's ironic how you're acting nothing like gentleman

"Oh? Good comeback I see, but do you know? I'm holding back... squat down."

Ivy: I'm sorry! It's a bad habit! My mouth go on its own!

"Ok sure, you can pee now... only on my right hand"

I thought it was going to be easy waving my hand around and let her chase it around like a pet chasing a toy but oh man, how wrong am I

Never once in my life have I been this startled, she lunges to my face so fast I could say she teleported, pin me down to the ground then start pissing on my hand without even taking her panties off.

Have you ever pour water on your hand? I guess that's how you probably imagined a girl pee on your hand feels, but this is not the case. It's like being sprayed with a warm water in summer from a pressurized hose.

Can I fight back? Yep, I have half of her strength plus mine. Should I do it? Nah, girl is having the best piss of her life. Ivy huffs and moans under her breath while unleashing her bladder contents on my hand. Her pussy is just barely above my right hand to pee on it so I reach my fingers up a little to touch it and tease her a little.

I can feels her puffy vulva under her drenched panties fabric. Her reaction was to jolts her hip upward just as much so I can't touch her private part, other than that she just keep peeing.

Her demon body seems to be able to hold much more than human could ever have. After a solid 2 minutes her stream calm down into a trickle then it stopped.

Ivy: haah that was the greatest relief I ever felt~ ...Master?

"I'm good... just go"

Ivy: won't you bring me back to your place?

"I can't just walk a wet demon around, and that apartment is not mine. This evening I'm gonna rent the room next to it, so just come when I'm there"

I fix her torn dress, clean her up, heal her bladder and let her fly away. Then I just walk back to Nora.

When I'm back at Julia's apartment I go to get the gold coin Julia gave me and prepare to go to the Yaha. The building I get Jamar, the cloth thingy that tell the soldiers I'm on their side. I think it's kinda like knights office or something like that

When I put the money in my pocket i heard a knock on the door.

Anna: Mr. Hero, are you in there?

"yeah, I'm here"

When I Open the door Ms Anna come in and proceed to lock the door I just opened and greed me with a sexy short skirt dress and a freaky smile. despite it being just a white dress her posture makes me wonder if she is wearing anything under it.

Before I could say anything Ms Anna shocked me

Anna: can I pee on you?

"Ms Anna?"

Anna: you know? I haven't use the restroom since you departed, my bladder is packed~

"What!?"

Anna: Ahhn~ my bladder's full, May I empty it on you, Mr hero?~

"what is going on!?"

Anna: You like this, don't you? C'mon look at my belly~ don't you like it when my bladder is pat pat this full?~

She proceeded to run her hand down from her chest, along her belly and stop just above the crotch of her skirt then pat down on where I assume is her bladder.

"I don't know what you're talking about, Ms Anna. Really!"

Anna: But it's ready to come out~~ don't you wanna have some fun with it until I burst? I won't tell anyone, oh shy boy~

I look around in panic, trying to find what the fuck is going on and then I see Ivy out the window, smiling suspiciously

"Y-Y-You You know Ivy, didn't you!? Don't come near me with that gaze! No!?"

She pinned me on the bed and sit on my legs just so her wedge is pressed on my dick. Though it have 3 or 2 if she didn't wear panties layers of fabric in between I can still feel my buddy getting squeeze between her pussy

Anna: It's ready to come out~ don't you wanna control it boy? Don't you want to take control of my piss filled bladder?

"What the fuck Ivy? Why is she trying to seduce me!?"

I turn my head and yelled at the mastermind who planned this situation but Ms Anna use her hand to tilt my head back to face her

Anna: Oh, don't be so cold. I'm on top of you, look at me.

Then she proceeds to leak a little on my dick

"my- my... //"

I was flustered from her behavior and the little piss patch on my pants. But I decided to try gain the control back.

Anna: Oh? My pussy is telling me there's something hard poking her lips, do you happen to know what is it~?

"ahh, that would by my buddy waiting to poke into a girl with bigggg bladder"

Anna: haah~ is my bladder big enough?

"I have to see"

Anna: Ah, it's coming out! Mr Hero, I'm leaking!

"Tch, is that how you wanna play? Hold it in!"

Anna: But! But my bladder is bursting!

I turn on my x-ray vision and look at her bladder to find that it's barely full, she just act it out. I feel kinda disappointed but given the little time I walk Ivy to piss it wouldn't fill that much.

The fact pull me out of my fantasy and make me think of the situation more critically. I figure Ivy is mind controlling her or Ms Anna is also a demon and is under Ivy's command. Either way I'm not gonna fall for her plan

"don't fake it, it's turning me off. Besides don't pee on Julia's bed"

Anna: ...you sure adapted fast...

"I hate fake feelings, since you want to seduce me so bad, how about you go drink some water and come back when you really feel it? Then maybe you can continue your stupid plan"

Anna: hmph, you're gonna be drenched when I'm back!

"I'd like to see you try"

Look at the reaction she gave me plus her actions. I concluded Ms Anna is just a pervert demon.

I watched Anna leaves the room then I turn to Ivy and give her a "punishment" for this situation.

"Ivy, drink a lot of water and hold your pee until I'm back"

Ivy: I'm in trouble...

I grab the coins and went out immediately, disappointed at them. I clean the patch of pee Anna has left on me and went down stairs to the lobby, asking where is the Yaha Julia went to. The answer they gave me was to turn right when I'm out the door and go straight down the path until I see the building with teal roof and armed soldier guarding the entrance. I thanked them and go

I follow the directions given and it leads me through the lively streets of Nora to the building I've been looking for, a building with teal roof and armed soldier guarding the entrance. This must be Yaha

Yaha

I walk up to the building and try to go in but the guards ask for my ID when I tell them i don't have one, they warn me not to come close or I'll be in trouble.

I feels offended, but they're just doing their job and I don't wanna trouble Julia inside so I'll just wait. Counting horse carriages passes by in the mean time. After a while I feel so bored I decided to create a water ball and throw it against the wall. The guards yelled at me to stop, but after the ball does nothing and just bounced back. They get that I'm just bored.

I waited a long while until finally a pretty cat girl walk out the entrance of The building, it was Julia.

I went straight to greet her

"hey, Julia~"

Julia: Oh, hi! Mister... um uh... hero?

"My name is Alex, just call me Alex"

Julia: sorry, Alex... I don't remember your name

"I don't remember telling you either, so it's not your fault. What were you doing?"

Julia: I was filling out forms and interviewed about our participation in the war

"you been gone for like from 5 am and you just finished?"

Julia: they ask me a lot...

"it was about me wasn't it?"

Julia: ...ahhh... not it's not like they view you in a bad way....

"I'm not that sensitive, just tell me"

Julia: they- they were... you need to know we don't have a lot of visitors okay?

"uh huh"

Julia: they wanted to investigate you...

"ahhh, I see"

Julia: it's all fine now, I did the paperwork and you just need to report to the town office... are you okay with that?

"sure, let's go"

I heard the deal, she did all this work for it to be this easy for me. All I have to do is going to the town office, I don't wanna trouble her more and that’s the least I can do. So I let Julia guide me there.

On the way I smell a very nice scent of cooked meat and spice, then I heard Julia sniff and her stomach growl.

Wait, she left since when I was still sleeping and that's like 6 in the morning, did she eat?

"Have you eaten something? Don't tell me you didn't eat since morning"

Julia: don't worry, I have some porridge this morning.

"are you hungry?"

Julia: um... we should rather hurry, I don't think it's good to have the mayor waiting.

"I don't think it's good to starve either, we're going to somewhere with food"

Julia: But-

"What would you do if I say I'm hungry?"

Julia: go to the market...

"then let's go grab some food first"

I don't know why she puts me before herself and the mayor but at least that make her listen to me. She need to have some meal or I'll be to blame. I have no idea if she's actualy older than me or not but my big brother instinct won't forgive me if she starves.

I thought it would be much closer guessing from the smell turns out it's actually mildly time consuming to walk to but at last we're at the market filled with food vendors. The food smell is so overwhelmingly good I'd actually drool.

"What do you want to eat?"

Julia: I mean I can't eat but if you're looking for recommendations-

"the fuck you mean you can't eat?"

Julia's ears flatten and her tail curled around her legs, she closed her eyes like she's ready to take a blow. People around me gasp as I said the F word.

I forgot people here don't swear often. so now they think I'm in so much rage and going to hit this poor cat girl.

"I'm not angry! I'm not angry! I'm sorry, I don't mean it. I forgot it's not normal here"

I explain myself while trying to be as less threatening as possible. People sigh out of relief and continue their doing. Then Julia Open one of her eye and see if I'm hitting her, which I'm not.

"Sorry, I was just wondering why you can't eat"

Julia: so no angry?

"no angry"

Julia: I don't have money...

"but you give me-"

...

"when you me give money I don't expect you to give me ALL your money!"

Julia: But- but that's what I can offer...

"No! I'm not taking it!"

Julia: B- But... do you want me as your wife instead?

"huh? Whattttt!?"

Julia: when- when a warrior saves a girl that's what she could offer... I- I'm not ready... but if you wanted to...

Julia blushes and poking her fingers together, then I realized she wasn't joking. She can be my wife I wanted to!? That's how much my authority I hold?

"I mean it's not a bad offer, but I mean I'm not taking any of your stuff!"

Julia: not a bad offer... blushes

"we're eating! we're eating! Where should we go?"

Julia: Ahhh! Sorry! ...should we buy from street vendors? Like on-stick food?

"on stick food?"

Julia: yes, you can eat while walking, so it won't take much time compare to a restaurant... or we could get fruit...

I was trying hard not to laugh but then I remembered, There's no cup or plastic bag to carry food in this world yet... It's start making sense and I apologize to her in my mind.

"Let's go with on-stick food, what do you like?"

Julia: I like chicken kemwan stick, it's easy to make on stick too so it's easy to find.

"kemwan stick?"

Julia: it's a stick version of traditional kemwan, a dish made with meats, vegetables and gar sauce. It's sweet, salty and smell very nice.

"gar?"

Julia: it's a very very nice smelling fruit.

"yeah, why not? Let's find it"

Julia leads me through the crowded market, it's kinda very very hot so I use my magic to make a cold breeze to blows through the market. When it comes, lot's of people sigh of relief. We keep searching for a while until Julia finds it. It's a market stall with doggy uncle as the vendor.

The food on the grill and plate are meats and vegetables skewered on a wood stick. It look a lot like barbecue which I see everywhere. I guess it's a popular food but Julia like chicken kemwan at this stall specifically.

I give back all the gold coins she gave me and tell her to buy for herself and I. She comes back after little while with like, 10 of them in each hands. Then she proceeds to feed me one

Julia: here's, aaaa~

"Bites, uhmm! Hat's hevy hoot! [That's very good]"

It's so good I'll tell you, it's like barbecue but more sweet and fruity, I don't know about gar but it's sure a delicious fruit.

She hand me half of them and I fucking devoured it. I shove one after another into my mouth untill it's all gone and I'm left with a bunch of sticks. Julia tells me to throw it in fire place at the town office since it's burnable.

I ask her if that would be rude and she answered "giving someone heat isn't rude" I now know how positive these people view is.

We keep walking and It turns out shoving the kemwan sticks in one go wasn't the best of ideas, now my throat feels all dry up...

"Do we have water? It's kinda salty and make me dehydrated"

Julia: I'm sorry, we should have go to a restaurant...

"what? No! I mean it's great. I just want to drink water"

Julia: we need to either go into a restaurant or to a well for that...

"There's no water vendors?"

Julia: No? Washing a cup is too much work for a vendor...

"Glass?"

Julia: isn't that for vine? It's expensive...

"right, let me just..."

I use my magic to collect and condense the water vapor in the air into water and drink it

Julia: No! You can't drink water from magic!

"why not?"

Julia: it's just gonna give you false sense of hydration and turn back into mana inside your body!

"Oh, my water is real, don't worry"

Julia: is that so? Then fine... just tell me if you feel sick, okay?

I don't think she understands but she either trust me or seen enough of my nonsense she just let it go.

After I was hydrated I continue following Julia's lead to the town office.

Town office

Julia: here it is, The town office.

"so we just go in?"

Julia: Nods

I go through the giant front door and stop to throw my stick into the fire place, it quickly burn into ashes and it really hit me. These people is so positive, it didn't actually give off that much warmth, it's just a way they view the action. Rather than view us as rude and careless they look at the positive part. I was humbled how different our society is.

Enough with the compliment. Anyways, Julia go to ask the lady at the counter where the mayor is. When she's done she return to me and ask me to follow her, She was very polite. I did follow her and then we arrived at the mayor office.

He look at us and smile

Mayor: Please sit down, It's nice to see you Ms Julia and Mr...

Julia: Alex, sir. His name is Alex.

Mayor: greeting Mr Alex, it is a honor to meet our war hero. Reach out

Shake hands "nice to meet you to Mr Mayor"

Mayor: Oh, didn't know you have my name, haha!

I'm confused, I don't know his name? What is he onto? I look at Julia and she whisper the explanation

Julia: His name is "Mayor clifht"

"I apologize, Mayor means mayor in my language"

Mayor: it's fine, now shall we make you an ID?

"Oh, that's nice. I thought you're going to interrogate me or something"

Mayor: Why would we do that? The defeat of demon army already show enough evidence, You're a good person!

"what if I'm just benefiting on you guys with the title hero?"

Mayor: even if that's not as heroic, you still saved our life nevertheless! What make you think we're gonna interrogate our savior like a criminal?

"I remember someone told Julia they wanted to interrogate me..."

Mayor: our folks may sometimes be xenophobic, but It's just cause they like Nora. I apologize on their behalf

"OK..."

Mayor: Ahem, let's make you a certified civilian shall we?

Xenophobic? Yeah, definitely something to expect. Nora civilians are very positive. If someone come and take advantage of them I would be mad too.

Mayor lead me to a room where I was placed on a table with someone who draw me while I need to write my personal information, which I obviously can't do since I can't read this side's language yet. I ask if Julia could write it for me, They don't have a problem with that so Julia start asking me the question and write down my answer. Luckily there were no awkward questions.

When it's all done the staff take the paper away, then the mayor speak

Mayor: Now let's get you a chest of gold... here!

"Oh thanks. just to make sure, you didn't give me like... all you money, right?"

I glance at Julia who's blushing out of embarrassment over her overgenerous actions.

Mayor: Oh Mr Alex, the town needs money to run. This is what you save us in damages. We saved these money to repair the town If it got destroyed, but since you save us from that whose money shall it be if it wasn't yours? haha!

Inside the chest there're thousands of gold coins. I got overwhelmed by the amount of money and look like Julia has the same reaction.

Honestly, I don't want it. I don't wanna be millionaire at the start of my journey, it's not fun. And what if they're another threat to Nora? What money would they use to recover from that if I take all of this?

"Julia, how much a gold coin worth in food?"

Julia: what? Um uhhh,I'm bad at thinking numbers...

"How much do you eat per day in terms of money?"

Julia: 40 to 60 copper... maybe 20 if i eat only rice...

"20 isn't divisible by three, how many meals do you eat each day?"

Julia: 2 breakfast and dinner... what's wrong? You eat three?

"yeah?"

I'm about to scold her out of my brother instinct but remember due to her job's nature, she probably be out in the wild at noon. So I just accepted it

"Anyway, how much copper coins is a gold coin?"

Julia: uhhhh, 10×10×10×10×10×10... one million?

"so you can live for almost 3 years while spending 1000 coppers a day?"

Julia: I- I can't think that much number...

"this is way too much to be comfortable sleeping at night..."

Julia: we don't have a lot of crime here...

"can I like, give you ten and give away the rest to the dead soldiers family?"

Julia: t-that's so kind of you, yes you can. I don't have control over your money...

I was also bothered by the guilt. Maybe if I act faster some of them wouldn't have died. So at least I could do is make sure their family can afford to live without them providing. So I decided to give this money to the dead soldiers's family.

I reach into the chest and pull out 20 gold coins. Ten for me ten for Julia.

"Mayor, I'll take just this. Give the rest to the fallen soldiers's family and keep the rest to protect the town"

Mayor: ...that's generous of you... Sure! I'll make sure they live a comfortable life and improve this town!⁵

"Deal, Then me and Julia are going home"

Mayor: Hope you'll be safe

We leave the town office and start walking back to the apartments building. On the way I decided to bring up the question I've been thinking of for a while since last night

"Hey, By the way last night you said you don't know what pads are, right?"

Julia: ah sorry, last night I was very embarrassed. they're the thick pieces of leather soldiers wears under their armor, right? I do not own them

"No, I mean the one you wear on your period"

Julia: period? What period? My time? I don't understand...

"uhhh, the time when you blood comes out from your vagina?"

Julia: that's terrifying! I've never experienced such horrible curse... I would bleed to death!

"You don't? ...Well it's not a curse, every mature girl in my world go through it every month. They experience pain in their abdomen, fluctuate emotions and the bleeding"

Julia: I do experience mood swings every month... other than that is just nightmarish... they are so tough able to going through that...

"it's part of their reproductive system. yeah I agree, my little sister is tough going through that every month"

Julia: do you bleed too?

"no, I don't. I don't think I even capable"

Julia: why?

"there're like blood clots also and I don't think it can fit through- wait...Julia, have you ever seen a penis?"

Julia: blushes eeeeh!? huh!? I- I've never seen one before...

Well that explains a lot...

"not even your dad's?"

Julia: n-no

"wanna see mine?"

Julia: haaah!?

"just kidding"

Julia: I thought you're gonna...

She has such legit reaction I think she actually belive me. Maybe this is not a great joke to these people...

"If there's no pads to hide, Then what make you embarrassed when I try to open your closet?"

Julia: blushes m-my underwear...

"oh, that's right"

Just like that? I'm struggling to find where the lines is...

Anyway we made it to Julia's apartment building or Tuma as Julia calls it. I don't wanna bother her room again and wanna have a bed of my own now that I have money, so I ask Julia to help me rent a room.

Julia Nodded and walk to the counter

Receptionist: hello, how can I help you?

Julia: I'm looking to rent a room for this person

"It'd be great if it's near Julia's"

Receptionist: how comes? did you guys fight?

"no, we're not. I just wanna have my own room and not bother her"

Receptionist: that'll be 2 iron per night- what?

"a month please"

I pull out one of the gold coins I just got from the mayor and put it on the counter. Julia and the receptionist seems surprised by my action, then Julia shake my arm and speak to me like I'm a toddler

Julia: No! You can't just give her a gold coin! It's hard to get the changes!

"sorry, I only have gold coins..."

Receptionist: it's fine, it's fine. I have the changes.

"and two dinner also"

Receptionist: that'll be 60 iron and 60 copper... here is your key and changes

She took my gold coins and give me the key, she turns back and take a long time finding changes. Then she turns back and give me a huge bag of coins which I assume is 9 big silver 9 silver 9 big iron 39 iron and 4 big copper by my academic calculations.

After we're done Julia turn to me with desperate looks

Julia: I'll go use the bathroom in my room first, is that okay?

"No"

Julia: But I have to pee...

"I'm just joking. go, before you hurt your bladder again"

Julia: it's not that bad yet... if you have anything to say-

Her bladder is full, she try to act normal but her tail was curling around her left thigh hugging it tightly. Her body language all tell me she's in a pinch, I don't want to tease her too much and make her associate me with her pee desperation so I'll let her go this time

"I have nothing to say and I'm not your boss to listen, just do yourself a favor and go pee"

Julia: okay...

"Let's meet again when we're done bathing shall we?"

Julia: fidgets sure

Then Julia went up the stairs to her room followed by me. She walk normally to not rush me but her curling tail tighten around her thigh as she walk. In response I walk faster so she won't have to worry about me.

When we're outside of our respective apartments. despite her full bladder wanting to be releases, Julia proceeds to stop qnd tell me to notify her anytime if there's a problem. Then she go inside her apartment. I wanted to be less of a creep but in the end I can't stop myself and spy on her

I see her desperately trying to put everything down and remove her clothing, Then she sit on the toilet and take a deep breath multiple time before she calm enough to pee. When she's done, I sighed and stop watching her doing her business.

I go to adjust the room to my liking. I sit on the bed and relaxed for a while until there's a knock on my door.

I opened to find the same dog girl from this morning, It was Anna.

Anna: Alex~ where have you been? You think you could escape?

She knows my name now...

Anna: you know how long I've been holding it in, waiting for you to come back?

"you haven't peed? ...for 6 hours?"

Anna: You bad bad boy making me wait this long, c'mon~ be still and let this dog mark her master~

Ah, I see. She's still determined to pee on me. I wanted check but her lower abdomen where her bladder is is poking out showing enough already.

She proceeds to rubs on the bulge and pad it, showing off her big bladder before speaking to me again

Anna: my bladder is all tighty now... Don't you wonder how long can this girl last?~

"I do~ good girl don't pee right?"

Anna: yes master~ I've been holding it in since you left~

Since she has done as told I'll just go her way and play this game. I want to make her hold her pee till the very last second so I'll just make it clear what I wanted

"Good girl hold it in"

Anna: But it's ready master~ my bladder is telling me it's time to mark my territory~~♡

"Oh? This bladder?"

@@pushes

Anna: hyangh!♡ Master~ don't treat it so roughly.

"after all it's been keeping all your pee in right?"

Anna: It's coming out master~

"oh no~ a good girl hold it in, don't you wanna be a good girl?"

Anna: I do master, I do!

She's pretty good at playing both bottom and top I'd say. She can both suppress me with her strength and be gentle and listening when I wanted

Anna: what can I do to put your meat in me, Master?♡

"Oh? You want this? How about you hold it in some more and let me poke your bladder from your vag?"

Anna: I'll do anything for you master~

...A-

The familiar magic circle appears on Anna's neck and collapse into a collar. Hah, that's strange. I wonder what this could be lol~

Ivy shove herself through the window and yell at Anna for her carelessness that failed their plan

Ivy: Anna you stupid dog! Didn't I just tell you to-

"rookies"

Anna: Master?

"Ivy, I told you to hold it in a lot right?"

Ivy: I'm gonna be able to pee once the plan success if it wasn't for this stupid dog!!

Anna: master~ Ivy blame me for her mistakes~

Ivy: Hey! Don't ask enemy for help!

"Both of you, sit immediately"

@@them: yes sir

"care to explain this "plan" to me?"

Ivy: first can I go to the toilet? Squirm

"no"

Anna: hah! good girl hold it in!

Ivy: you fucking-

"Ivy, shut up or I'll make you hold it in until tomorrow"

Ivy: why am I the one who get bullied? ...Hmph! whatever!

"Anna, what did your guys plan to do?"

Anna: When I see master with Ivy this morning, I see her bladder reaaally big. So I think master like big bladder girl, so I hold my pee for master~♡

"why me?"

Anna: master smell reaaally good, that's why

"huh?"

Ivy: she means your mana, she smells mana from you.

"So why were you trying to smash me?"

Anna: Ivy tell me to make master cry for mercy, telling me Master will give up everything for me

"ahh, so that's why. Do you really like me for real or just doing what your boss said?"

Ivy: I'm not her boss... we're on the same rank...

Anna: Master's smell make me feels itchy in certain place~

"so what's your ability then?"

Anna: when I make babies with someone I get their mana~!

"that's... fitting I guess"

Anna: if Ivy didn't get in the way I would have got master's cu- mana* hehe~

Ivy: shut up you lustfull creature!

Anna: I'm the sin of lust after all~♡

"wait, if Anna is the sin of lust so what are you? Sin of stupidity?"

Ivy: You- Fucking insolent Bastard! I'm gonna rip your head-

"I'm gonna make you tear yourself into millions of pieces and feed your own fragments to cows"

Ivy: I'm sorry, please don't....

Anna: master, that's cruel...

"Jeez, I'm just joking! So which sin are you exactly?"

Ivy: S-sloth...

"yeah.. guess from your ability that's probably it"

Ivy: please don't hurt me...

"I'm sorry, OK? I don't mean it! I thought with that attitude you'd be able to take it well"

Ivy: I-It's different when you are capable to do that...

"I swear it's just an empty thread, Just move on okay?"

Ivy: Nods

I feels like I'm like a monster in Ivy's eyes and that doesn't bring me joy. I kinda feel bad saying that. But like, how could I know she'd be all shaking terrified like this?

Before I fell into the bad thoughts, Anna pull me out. I don't know if she knows what I think about or it's just a good timing. But she saved me from having a mental crisis.

Anna: Master, pee...

"you two just go use my bathroom, I'm not in the mood anymore"

Anna: are you going to watch?

"Anna, act more like just a needy girl and not pet sex slave please"

Anna: Master like that more?

"Honestly you're so committed it's kinda take away the fun. Is this your real self? If not, be yourself. it's not the same if you're acting"

Anna: I just want my partner in bed to be happy...

"that's sweet (if not considering the part she basically kill them by having sex) but I want you to be yourself, not what you think I wanted you to be"

Anna: I understand... but I didn't lie when I said I want to do it with you. Know that, okay?

"next time"

I turned to Ivy who's gripping her crotch and sit on the floor. Wondering where would she go that now her title have been stripped away

"so where are you going to sleep, Ivy?"

Ivy: Lust's room...

Anna: I'm gonna take your virginity Sloth~!

Ivy: please don't

Honestly, with her personality I've seen so far. I couldn't tell if she's serious or not

"You good with girls too?"

Anna: I'm fine with them too yes, but this time I was just joking

"Why you two call each other by sin?"

Ivy: it's more comfortable for me...

Anna: Miss Ivary is kinda...

"just call each other Ivy and Anna or something?"

Ivy: we're not close... actually. You just casually start calling me that but if the other sin refer to me with that name... it's gonna be embarrassing

Anna: I'm fine either way. But I prefer being called a good girl too

"When I think about it, isn't that racist?"

Anna: some would be offended, yes. but I actually do enjoy being called a good girl~

"okay, we should stop talking before Ivy burst her bladder. You two are dismissed"

They got up and rush to the bathroom. I just turn around and sit on my bed

Not a moment can I relax, I hear Ivy screaming from the bathroom. When I went to check on them, I see Ivy trying to close the door and Anna shoving herself halfway through the door.

Ivy: master! Anna is teasing me!

Anna: I need to pee too!!

"Anna, just let her pee"

Anna: um! Yes sir!

Anna get out from between the door and stand up straight like a soldier, it was funny. She then wait for a while until she can't. Anna can't keep her her calm any more and start walking in circle in front of the bathroom. Just like I told, She did drink some water and hold it in and I think she have been holding for too long.

Her bladder is keeping too much pee in beyond the safe level, it's bulging and leaking into her urethra tube. Her tail wags around in desperation... or excitement, I can't tell... her lower body twisting and curling to compensate for the pressure in her reservoir.

"How about you go use the toilet in your room, Anna?"

Anna: I can do it! I can hold it in until she's done... ahh!

"did you just leaked?"

Anna: do you like it-? Hahh... ngggh...

"so this is your limit... yep, I do like it"

Anna: Then I'm happy- to- pee... my... self... haaa~♡

After waiting for too long she gives up holding her pee against the urge. Her tail jumped straight and she bend down, her bladder spasmed and caused her to leak. It take her roughly 10 seconds until she lost all control of her urinary muscles. Her bladder squeezes, her urethral sphincter relaxes and her pee burst out of the confinement of her urinary track.

"You know this is MY room right? Don't wet yourself on the floor!"

Anna tried to block her pee hole with her fingers, but it seems like she cannot handle the level of desperation she's asking for from stopping her body's emergency protocol. After a moment of the flood being stop the dam broke. Anna emptied her entire bladder on the floor in front of the bathroom, She created a very large puddle of steaming pee where she stand.

Anna: I can't stop! I can't stop~♡

"fine, piss as much as you want. I'll clean it up"

When Ivy comes out she and see Anna with her mess has a shocked reaction. It was to be expected, but she look more shocked than I expected. I was curious, Until Anna turn to face me. I see her blushing and look embarrassed. Now I know why Ivy is shocked, I shocked too. Anna seems to be the shameless beast type of girl, seeing her blushing from embarrassment is quite a sight.

"Yo, you're blushing"

Ivy: Lust?

Anna: I've- I've never wet myself before... it-It's very exciting huff huff

Her hand previously used to seal her pee hole start moving around on her crotch, Anyone would say she's rubbing herself. The other hand is closing her mouth from letting out any moans

Anna: hah hah hahhh

"Oi, don't touch yourself in my room"

Ivy: Lust!

Anna: I'm just catching my breath! ><

"hands girl, hands"

Anna: I-It's doing on it's own!

I look at the massive puddle and sigh then I use telekinesis to collect Anna's pee into a floating ball that's actually larger than her bladder, I don't exactly know why but I think their demonic power gives their bladder more durability. Both girl look surprise and blushes as I walk pass them to the toilet and dump the ball of steaming piss in it.

I also use my magic to dry and clean their wet clothes. Due to the fighting of who's using the bathroom first Ivy wetted her panties a little, it's just a tiny patch so I just dry it. Anna however, I need to pull all her piss from her skirt and panties and throw it into the toilet.

When everything is dry all it left is stench of urea. I figure I should just clean the smell by collecting the smell molecules and shove them down the drain. So I'll just do it when I'm done bathing along with my clothes. Julia could be done when I'm finished bathing and see these two come out of my room, so I'll just make them leave before she's done.

"Imma go bath and have dinner with Julia then I'm going straight to sleep after. You guys go to your room and do your stuff okay?"

Ivy: yes sir

Anna: okay~

Both demon is more comply than I thought and that's a good thing. Anna leaves to her room with Ivy following her. Though I don't know what would Anna do to her, It's not my problem.

I filled the bathtub with warm water and take of my clothes. Then I go in and sigh out of relief, it's a heaven on land after a long day~

After I enjoyed my bath, I clean up my clothes along with the smell by my magic and get ready to eat the dinner.

I got outside and see Julia waiting. Her hair still moist so I don't think she waited that long. I tell her to come closer and tilt her head down. She's confused but does it anyway. That's when I start blowing warm wind out of my hand onto her head like a hair dryer. Her ears wiggle as I move my hand around her head to dry all her hair.

In the end her hair become fluffy and has much more volume than before

Julia: What was that?

"It's drying, so you don't have to wait for your hair to dry on its own and clumps together"

Julia: Oh thanks, are you ready for dinner?

"sniff my clothes"

Julia: blushes Eh!? ...OK sniff sniff

"How is it?"

Julia: it smell great! ...and kinda like Ms Anna

"Oh? You can tell? Yep I talked to her"

Glad I clean the pee smell, I don't wanna think about how would she react if she smells Anna's pee all over my clothes

"should we go?"

@@julia: um! Nods

We went down to the cafeteria to a table. The waitress seeing us yelled into the kitchen and in a short time they bring out our meal. And laid it on the table.

I start the conversation by thanking her for doing 6 hours of paper work for me.

"thanks for the hardwork"

Julia: ?

"this morning when you cleared my paperwork and your help in the town office"

Julia: Oh, it's nothing. Me and Nora could never thank you enough for your help.

"glad to hear that"

Julia: so should we go to the gate now that you're done with this side

"huh?"

Julia: Nonono! I don't mean to tell you to go away, just that wouldn't your family be worried? You mentioned your sister would starve and everything so I-

"no need for the explanation, I know. But even If I'm not back home my little sister would buy something to eat anyway"

Thinking about it Yuki would be happy actually, having no one cook for her means she have an excuse to buy convenient store food as much as she likes and blame it on me lol.

Julia: But don't you miss your family? I don't wanna keep you around against your will...

"Actually, I'm about to tell you"

Julia: ?

"I live in both world at once"

Julia: what? How does that work?

"it turn out my original body is still on that side. When I sleep in one body, the other one wakes up. So I can still cook for my sister"

Julia: ...wouldn't that make you very fatigue?

"No? My body in each side have sleep. Just that I won't be in the sleeping one"

Julia: ...I don't wanna be rude, but don't your mind need sleep?

"it's the other way around, mind don't need sleep. It's the body who make you feels sleepy when it's tired"

Julia: ...but it's the feeling! You feel it in your mind!

"tell me Julia, when you really need to pee is it the mind telling you to pee because you given do so or your body needs to let it out?"

Julia: my body...

"yep, just like sleep"

Julia: I thought it was because I was thinking all day my mind wanted a break

"might be... We're not the same after all."

Julia: So you don't have to leave?

"yep"

Julia: sigh

"I do wonder if we have kids which side would they belong to"

Julia: Haaah!?? K-kids?

Julia cough out her dinner and look at me then everybody turned to me.

"Sorry, I didn't think before I said that..."

Julia: I don't think I'm ready to be a mother...

"I'm just talking about it hypothetically!"

Julia: hypothetically?

"I mean If it were to happen, not that I'm gonna just put kids in you tonight, God dammit"

Everyone gasped. then I realized I cursed again. This time however, Julia seems to be just scared not terrified. Maybe she's adapting to my way of talking

"Sorry about that, I'm not angry"

Julia: ...No divine imprisonment?

"I don't think I can do that..."

Julia: you seems capable...

"I swear no one is getting damned this night"

Julia: ...that's reassuring

"I'm not a prideful heroes who's not to mess with. I'm just a guy! you don't have to be afraid"

Julia: I don't think you are one! It's just my reflex I swear!

"You're telling me if someone swear, you would react the same?"

Julia: If someone curse at me, I would cry...

"so why aren't you crying"

Julia: you wouldn't fo that to me.. would you?

Julia peek at me with pleading eyes

"no..."

We sit awkwardly after that. I find it uncomfortable so I wanna start a conversation. I look around, searching for a topic and my eyes landed on the weird clump on my plate. Because I just say 2 dinner when I ordered. Me and Julia have the exact same dish served.

Julia seems to be enjoying this part of the plate so I think I can use it as a topic

"Wanna have my uh... this?"

Julia: it's diced gar and cream, it's a dessert. you can have it, I'm fine

"I don't think I like how it looks..."

Julia: No! That's rude to the chef! Besides, you haven't tasted it yet!

"sorry"

I thought I got a good topic but it backfired, mostly because I was careless Julia talked to me like a toddler again.

Now knowing what it was I was more confident to taste the thing. And she was right, it's delicious. I have worry with dairy products since there's no fridge here, but it turns out okay. The cream is... well creamy but gar is what makes it very delicious. It have chewy texture and fruity scent like a gummy. I ended up shoving the whole thing down in seconds

"Hmm! It's delicious!"

Julia: see?

Julia then speak to me with the most smug face I've seen her do, She looks cute. Then I see some of the cream left on the corner of her mouth

"You have a little on your mouth..."

I reach my hand out and wipe the cream from her mouth with my thumb then proceeded to lick it out of habit.

Julia: thanks~

I thought I messed up and make her embarrassed, but turns out everything is okay. She was happy to be cleaned and fine with food not being wasted.

We have the rest of the dinner together while talking about my sister. When we're done I turn to ask Julia of what to do next

"should we go?"

Julia: to sleep? Probably...

"Let's go then"

Julia: Nods

With the affirmation we get up and head to the stairs closest to our room. When we leave I see the waitress quickly clean up the table as we leave.

Me and Julia walk to the second ant to our respective room. Julia turn her head to me and smile

Julia: goodnight, Alex

"goodnight, Julia"

@@that was captivating

I grip my chest from her cuteness. Then I sigh, I should probably go to sleep...

I go to lay on my bed, watching to ceiling until I was able to sleep. Before I dose off I blow out the candle with my magic.

END
