Anybody remember the minor naruto villain Jirobou? He was a part one villain, part of the Sound 4 that helped Sasuke run away from the village. He lost to Chouji using the calorie control butterfly wings for the first time. Anyway, I was just thinking what if Sakura and a group of other kunoichi from Konoha had gone up against that dude instead? They would have been able to do fuck all against his earth barrier technique that traps you and slowly drains your chalkra.

So the premise of the story is this: Sakura, Ino, Hinata, and sure I guess Tenten can be there even thou she’s the worst, anyway these four get sent as the sasuke retrival squad instead naruto, shikamaru and them. They get trapped by jirobou, just like naruto’s group did, only instead of escaping (cause they don’t have anyone remotely strong enough) they just get their chalkra completely drained and end up trapped there. Now who else sees the possibility for some serious desperation and wetting in this scenario? Best part is that it won’t even have to stray that far from cannon as most fanfics tend to.

This is just me brainstorming, I’ll probably get to writing the story proper sometime next week, and I’ll just post it as a reply to this thread. It’ll be medium length, nothing crazy like the Phases story I’m still working on. Let me know if you like the idea or anything you think would be cool to happen in it, thanks!
